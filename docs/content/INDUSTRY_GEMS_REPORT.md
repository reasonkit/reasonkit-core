## Part 3: Quality Tier Gems

### Claude Opus 4.5: The Effort Parameter

The hidden feature nobody's talking about:

```
"effort": "high"  // More compute, more accuracy
"effort": "low"   // Faster, cheaper, still good
```

**Stat:** 50-75% fewer errors with effort=high

**Content Angle:** "Claude's Secret Weapon Is One Parameter"
