# OSS vs. Pro Module Allocation Strategy

**Version:** 1.0 (Pre-Launch Finalization)
**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Goal:** Maximize ubiquity (OSS) while protecting sustainability (Pro).

---

## The Philosophy: "Primitives vs. Solutions"

- **Open Source (Primitives):** The fundamental building blocks of reasoning. If it's a "cognitive action" (e.g., "deduce," "critique," "verify"), it belongs in the core. We want these to become the standard library of AI.
- **Pro (Solutions):** The orchestration of primitives into complex, business-specific workflows. If it's a "business outcome" (e.g., "Risk Analysis," "Decision Matrix," "Scientific Research"), it belongs in Pro.

## 1. The OSS Core (Apache 2.0)

_Free forever. The hook._

| Module            | Function            | Why OSS?                                           |
| :---------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **GigaThink**     | Divergent Thinking  | Basic brainstorming. Table stakes.                 |
| **LaserLogic**    | Deductive Reasoning | Logic is infrastructure. Must be free.             |
| **BedRock**       | First Principles    | Breaking things down is fundamental.               |
| **ProofGuard**    | Verification        | Reliability is our brand. Can't gate safety.       |
| **BrutalHonesty** | Critique            | Self-correction is essential for any usable agent. |

**Strategy:** These 5 modules allow a developer to build _anything_. They are the "LEGO bricks." By making them free, we prevent competitors from undercutting us on basic capability.

## 2. The Pro Tier (Commercial License)

_Paid. The retainer._

| Module          | Function                | Why Pro?                                                                          |
| :-------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AtomicBreak** | Recursive Decomposition | **Complexity Management.** Solves "too big to handle" problems. Enterprise scale. |
| **HighReflect** | Metacognition & Bias    | **Management Layer.** It manages other agents. High value for leaders.            |
| **RiskRadar**   | Threat Modeling         | **Insurance.** Companies pay to avoid bad outcomes. Pure ROI.                     |
| **DeciDomatic** | Multi-Criteria Decision | **Executive Function.** Replaces expensive consultants/meetings.                  |
| **SciEngine**   | Scientific Method Loop  | **R&D Automation.** specialized workflow for pharma/research.                     |

**Strategy:** These modules represent "Senior Engineer" or "Manager" level capabilities. They don't just "think"—they _manage complexity and risk_. Companies pay for risk reduction.

## 3. The Feature Split (Beyond Modules)

| Feature           | OSS (Free)         | Pro (Paid)                    |
| :---------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Deploy Target** | Local Binary / CLI | Hosted API / Docker Container |
| **Audit Logs**    | Local SQLite       | Centralized Cloud Dashboard   |
| **Team Size**     | 1 User (Personal)  | Unlimited (Collaboration)     |
| **Rate Limit**    | None (BYO Key)     | None (BYO Key) or Managed     |
| **Support**       | Community (GitHub) | Priority (Slack/Email)        |
| **SSO/SAML**      | No                 | Yes                           |

## 4. The "Trojan Horse" Strategy

1.  **Individual developers** install OSS ReasonKit to fix their own flaky prompts.
2.  **They get addicted** to the "ProofGuard" reliability and the SQLite audit trails.
3.  **Their boss asks** "Why did the AI say that?"
4.  **Developer shows** the local audit log.
5.  **Boss asks** "Can we have this for the whole team?"
6.  **Developer says** "We need the Pro version for centralized logging and SSO."
7.  **Sale.**

## 5. Verification Checklist (Task 53)

- [x] **Differentiation:** Is the line clear? Yes (Primitives vs. Solutions).
- [x] **Adoption Friction:** Is the OSS version "crippleware"? No. It is fully functional for a single user.
- [x] **Upgrade Trigger:** Is there a compelling reason to upgrade? Yes. Collaboration and Advanced Workflows.
- [x] **License Safety:** Apache 2.0 allows commercial use (good for adoption), but Pro modules remain proprietary (good for revenue).

**Verdict:** The allocation is sound. Proceed to launch.
