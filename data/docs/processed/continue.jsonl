{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"core/nextEdit/README.md","content":"# Next Edit Prediction\n\n## What is it?\n\n## How is it different from autocomplete?\n\n## Where are we right now?\n\n- Users can decide to switch between autocomplete and next edit.\n- Next edit triggers at the same time autocomplete is triggered, via vscode's inline completion provider.\n- The following happens after the trigger:\n  - User's current cursor position is captured.\n  - We define an editable range, ±5 lines from the current cursor position.\n  - User's most recent edit is captured as a unified diff. (this is currently buggy)\n  - This is sent to the model, which returns a new editable range with next edit predictions.\n  - We display this new editable range in a SVG decoration.\n  - User can either tab to accept or esc to reject.\n    - On accept, the old editable range will be replaced by the new editable region. The cursor will be moved to the last line containing some change.\n    - On reject, nothing happens.\n\n## What needs to be worked on?\n\n- User edit captures.\n- Find a better way to trigger next edit (this links back to the diff capture problem).\n  - We can see that next edit triggers as soon as the user accepts a change. This is because autocomplete runs the same way.\n  - I think autocomplete has some filter logic that doesn't display the ghost text under some conditions, which I am guessing are the following:\n    - The model does not have any more completions to create.\n    - The prediction at the cursor location has been cached.\n- JetBrains integration.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"core/indexing/README.md","content":"# Indexing\n\nContinue uses a tagging system along with content addressing to ensure that nothing needs to be indexed twice. When you change branches, Continue will only re-index the files that are newly modified and that we don't already have a copy of. This system can be used across many different \"artifacts\" just by implementing the `CodebaseIndex` class.\n\n_artifact_: something that is generated by indexing and then saved to be used later (e.g. emeddings, full-text search index, or a table of top-level code snippets in each file)\n\n_cacheKey_: a key that determines whether two files can be considered the same to avoid re-indexing (always hash of file contents at this point)\n\n_`CodebaseIndex`_: a class that makes it easy to use the indexing system to help you generate a new artifact\n\nThe indexing process does the following:\n\n1. Check the modified timestamps of all files in the repo (this may seem extreme, but checking timestamps is significantly faster than actually reading a file. Git does the same thing.)\n2. Compare these to a \"catalog\" (stored in SQLite) of the last time that we indexed each of these files to get a list of files to \"add\" or \"remove\". If the file exists in the repo but not in the catalog, then we must \"add\" the file. If it exists in the catalog but not the repo, we must \"remove\" the file. If it exists in both and was modified after last indexed, then we must update the file. In this case we also add it to the \"add\" list.\n3. For each file to \"add\", check whether it was indexed on another branch. Here we use a SQLite table that acts as a cache for indexed files. If we find an entry in this table for a file with the same cacheKey, then we only need to add a tag to this entry for the current branch (\"addTag\"). Otherwise, we must \"compute\" the artifact.\n4. For each file in \"remove\", check whether it was indexed on another branch. If we find only one entry with the same cacheKey (presumably this should be the entry for the current branch, or something has gone wrong), then this entry should be removed and there will be no more branches that need the artifact, so we want to \"delete\" it. If there is more than one tag on this artifact, then we should just remove the tag for this branch (\"removeTag\").\n5. After having calculated these four lists of files (\"compute\", \"delete\", \"addTag\", \"removeTag\"), we pass them to the `CodebaseIndex` so that it can update whatever index-specific storage it might have. Many of them use SQLite and/or LanceDB. The `CodebaseIndex` implements a method called \"update\" that accepts the four lists and yields progress updates as it iterates over the lists. These progress updates are used to officially mark a file as having been indexed, so that if the extension is closed mid-indexing we don't falsely record progress.\n\n## Existing `CodebaseIndex`es\n\nAll indexes must be returned by `getIndexesToBuild` in [`CodebaseIndexer.ts`](./CodebaseIndexer.ts) if they are to be used.\n\n`CodeSnippetsCodebaseIndex`: uses tree-sitter queries to get a list of functions, classes, and other top-level code objects in each file\n`FullTextSearchCodebaseIndex`: creates a full-text search index using SQLite FTS5\n`ChunkCodebaseIndex`: chunks files recursively by code structure, for use in other embeddings providers like `LanceDbIndex`\n`LanceDbIndex`: calculates embeddings for each chunk and adds them to the LanceDB vector database, with metadata going into SQLite. Note that for each branch, a unique table is created in LanceDB.\n\n## Known problems\n\n- `FullTextSearchCodebaseIndex` doesn't differentiate between tags (branch, repo), so results may come from any branch/repo. LanceDB does this by creating separate tables for each tag (see `tableNameForTag`). The chunk index does this with a second table\n"}

Run 🤗 Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server!\n\nTransformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face's [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:\n\n- 📝 **Natural Language Processing**: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.\n- 🖼️ **Computer Vision**: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n- 🗣️ **Audio**: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.\n- 🐙 **Multimodal**: zero-shot image classification.\n\nTransformers.js uses [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to run models in the browser. The best part about it, is that you can easily [convert](#convert-your-models-to-onnx) your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX using [🤗 Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum#onnx--onnx-runtime).\n\nFor more information, check out the full [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js).\n\n## Quick tour\n\nIt's super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the python library, we support the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it the easiest way to run models with the library.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th width=\"440px\" align=\"center\"><b>Python (original)</b></th>\n<th width=\"440px\" align=\"center\"><b>Javascript (ours)</b></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\npipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n\nout = pipe('I love transformers!')\n# [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999806941}]\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```javascript\nimport { pipeline } from \"@xenova/transformers\";\n\n// Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\nlet pipe = await pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\");\n\nlet out = await pipe(\"I love transformers!\");\n// [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999817686}]\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nYou can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the second argument to the `pipeline` function. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use a different model for sentiment-analysis\nlet pipe = await pipeline(\n  \"sentiment-analysis\",\n  \"Xenova/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment\",\n);\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xenova/transformers), run:\n\n```bash\nnpm i @xenova/transformers\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use it in vanilla JS, without any bundler, by using a CDN or static hosting. For example, using [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), you can import the library with:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import { pipeline } from \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xenova/transformers@2.14.0\";\n</script>\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nWant to jump straight in?

You can customize this as follows:\n\n### Settings\n\n```javascript\nimport { env } from \"@xenova/transformers\";\n\n// Specify a custom location for models (defaults to '/models/').\nenv.localModelPath = \"/path/to/models/\";\n\n// Disable the loading of remote models from the Hugging Face Hub:\nenv.allowRemoteModels = false;\n\n// Set location of .wasm files. Defaults to use a CDN.\nenv.backends.onnx.wasm.wasmPaths = \"/path/to/files/\";\n```\n\nFor a full list of available settings, check out the [API Reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/api/env).\n\n### Convert your models to ONNX\n\nWe recommend using our [conversion script](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/blob/main/scripts/convert.py) to convert your PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX in a single command. Behind the scenes, it uses [🤗 Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum) to perform conversion and quantization of your model.\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id <model_name_or_path>\n```\n\nFor example, convert and quantize [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) using:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id bert-base-uncased\n```\n\nThis will save the following files to `./models/`:\n\n```\nbert-base-uncased/\n├── config.json\n├── tokenizer.json\n├── tokenizer_config.json\n└── onnx/\n    ├── model.onnx\n    └── model_quantized.onnx\n```\n\nFor the full list of supported architectures, see the [Optimum documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/exporters/onnx/overview).\n\n## Supported tasks/models\n\nHere is the list of all tasks and architectures currently supported by Transformers.js.\nIf you don't see your task/model listed here or it is not yet supported, feel free\nto open up a feature request [here](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/issues/new/choose).\n\nTo find compatible models on the Hub, select the \"transformers.js\" library tag in the filter menu (or visit [this link](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers.js)).\nYou can refine your search by selecting the task you're interested in (e.g., [text-classification](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification&library=transformers.js)).\n\n### Tasks\n\n#### Natural Language Processing\n\n| Task

Unlike basic telemetry, dev data includes lots of details into the complete software development workflow, including code context, user interactions, and development patterns.\n\n## Core Architecture\n\n### Primary Implementation Files\n\n- **`/core/data/log.ts`**: Main `DataLogger` class - singleton for event logging and remote transmission\n- **`/packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/data/`**: Schema definitions for all event types\n\n### Storage Locations\n\n- **Default storage**: `~/.continue/dev_data/`\n- **Event files**: `~/.continue/dev_data/{version}/{eventName}.jsonl`\n\n## Event Types and Schemas\n\n### Core Event Types\n\n1. **`tokensGenerated`**: LLM token usage tracking\n2. **`autocomplete`**: Code completion interactions\n3. **`chatInteraction`**: Chat-based development assistance\n4. **`editInteraction`**: Code editing sessions\n5. **`editOutcome`**: Results of edit operations\n6. **`nextEditOutcome`**: Next Edit feature outcomes\n7. **`chatFeedback`**: User feedback on AI responses\n8. **`toolUsage`**: Tool interaction statistics\n9. **`quickEdit`**: Quick edit functionality usage\n\n### Schema Versioning\n\n- **Version 0.1.0**: Initial schema implementation\n- **Version 0.2.0**: Current schema with expanded fields and metadata\n- **Schema files**: Located in `/packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/data/`\n\n### Base Schema Structure\n\nAll events inherit from a base schema (`/packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/data/base.ts`):\n\n```typescript\n{\n  eventName: string,\n  schema: string,\n  timestamp: string,\n  userId: string,\n  userAgent: string,\n  selectedProfileId: string\n}\n```\n\n## Key Integration Points\n\n### Autocomplete System\n\n- **File**: `/core/autocomplete/util/AutocompleteLoggingService.ts`\n- **Purpose**: Tracks code completion acceptance/rejection, timing, and cache hits\n- **Integration**: Called from autocomplete engine when completions are shown/accepted\n\n### Chat Interface\n\n- **Integration**: Chat interactions logged through `DataLogger.logDevData()`\n- **Data**: Includes prompts, responses, context, and user feedback\n- **Privacy**: Can be configured to exclude code content\n\n### Edit Features\n\n- **Files**: `/extensions/vscode/src/extension/EditOutcomeTracker.ts`, `/core/nextEdit/NextEditLoggingService.ts`\n- **Purpose**: Track edit suggestions, acceptance rates, and outcomes\n- **Integration**: Embedded in edit workflow to capture user decisions\n\n### LLM Token Tracking\n\n- **File**: `/core/llm/index.ts`\n- **Purpose**: Track token usage across all LLM providers\n- **Storage**: SQLite database for efficient querying and reporting\n\n## Configuration and Customization\n\n### Configuration Structure\n\nDev data is configured through `data` blocks in your Continue config:\n\n```yaml\ndata:\n  - name: \"Local Development Data\"\n    destination: \"file:///Users/developer/.continue/dev_data\"\n    schema: \"0.2.0\"\n    level: \"all\"\n    events: [\"autocomplete\", \"chatInteraction\", \"editOutcome\"]\n\n  - name: \"Team Analytics\"\n    destination: \"https://analytics.yourcompany.com/api/events\"\n    schema: \"0.2.0\"\n    level: \"noCode\"\n    apiKey: \"your-api-key-here\"\n    events: [\"tokensGenerated\", \"toolUsage\"]\n```\n\n### Configuration Options\n\n- **`destination`**: Where to send data (`file://` for local, `http://`/`https://` for remote)\n- **`schema`**: Schema version to use (`\"0.1.0\"` or `\"0.2.0\"`)\n- **`level`**: Data detail level (`\"all\"` includes code, `\"noCode\"` excludes code content)\n- **`events`**: Array of event types to collect\n- **`apiKey`**: Authentication for remote endpoints\n\n### Privacy Controls\n\n- **`\"all\"` level**: Includes code content (prefixes, suffixes, completions)\n- **`\"noCode\"` level**: Excludes code content, only metadata and metrics\n- **Local-first**: Data is always stored locally, remote transmission is optional\n\n## Making Changes to Dev Data\n\n### Adding New Event Types\n\n1. **Create schema**: Add new event schema in `/packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/data/`\n2. **Update index**: Add to schema aggregator in `/packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/data/index.ts`\n3. **Implement logging**: Add logging calls in relevant service files\n4. **Update version**: Consider schema version bump if breaking changes\n\n### Modifying Existing Events\n\n1. **Schema changes**: Update schema files in `/packages/config-yaml/src/schemas/data/`\n2. **Backward compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing data consumers\n3. **Version management**: Increment schema version for breaking changes\n4. **Test thoroughly**: Validate schema changes with existing data\n\n### Adding New Logging Points\n\n1. **Import DataLogger**: `import { DataLogger } from \"core/data/log\"`\n2. **Log events**: Call `DataLogger.getInstance().logDevData(eventName, data)`\n3. **Follow patterns**: Use existing logging services as examples\n4. **Validate data**: Ensure logged data matches schema requirements\n\n### Debugging Dev Data Issues\n\n1. **Check local storage**: Verify files are being created in `~/.continue/dev_data/`\n2. **Validate schemas**: Ensure event data matches expected schema format\n3. **Review configuration**: Check `data` blocks in Continue config\n4. **Test endpoints**: Verify remote endpoints are reachable and accepting data\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### When Adding New Events\n\n- Follow existing naming conventions for event types\n- Include sufficient context for analysis without oversharing sensitive data\n- Consider privacy implications and respect user configuration levels\n- Add appropriate error handling and logging\n\n### When Modifying Schemas\n\n- Maintain backward compatibility when possible\n- Document schema changes thoroughly\n- Consider impact on existing data consumers\n- Test with real development data\n\n### When Integrating Logging\n\n- Use the singleton pattern: `DataLogger.getInstance()`\n- Log events at appropriate points in user workflow\n- Respect user privacy settings and configuration\n- Handle errors gracefully without disrupting user experience\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Service-Based Logging\n\nMost dev data logging follows a service pattern:\n\n```typescript\nexport class FeatureLoggingService {\n  private dataLogger = DataLogger.getInstance();\n\n  logFeatureUsage(data: FeatureUsageData) {\n    this.dataLogger.logDevData(\"featureUsage\", data);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Event-Driven Logging\n\nEvents are typically logged at key interaction points:\n\n```typescript\n// When user accepts autocomplete\nonAutocompleteAccepted(completion: CompletionData) {\n  AutocompleteLoggingService.getInstance().logAutocompleteAccepted(completion);\n}\n```\n\nThis guide provides the foundation for understanding and working with Continue's dev data system. Always prioritize user privacy and follow established patterns when making changes.\n"}

These aren't the only ways, but are a great starting point if you are new to the project. You\ncan also browse the list\nof [good first issues](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues?q=is:issue%20state:open%20label:good-first-issue).\n\n## 🐛 Report Bugs\n\nIf you find a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues) to report it! A great bug\nreport includes:\n\n- A description of the bug\n- Steps to reproduce\n- What you expected to happen\n- What actually happened\n- Screenshots or videos\n\n## ✨ Suggest Enhancements\n\nContinue is quickly adding features, and we'd love to hear which are the most important to you. The best ways to suggest\nan enhancement are:\n\n- Create an issue\n\n  - First, check whether a similar proposal has already been made\n  - If not, [create an issue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues)\n  - Please describe the enhancement in as much detail as you can, and why it would be useful\n\n- Join the [Continue Discord](https://discord.gg/NWtdYexhMs) and tell us about your idea in the `#feedback` channel\n\n## 📖 Updating / Improving Documentation\n\nContinue is continuously improving, but a feature isn't complete until it is reflected in the documentation! If you see\nsomething out-of-date or missing, you can help by clicking \"Edit this page\" at the bottom of any page\non [docs.continue.dev](https://docs.continue.dev).\n\n### Running the Documentation Server Locally\n\nYou can run the documentation server locally using either of the following methods:\n\n#### Method 1: NPM Script\n\n1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `docs` subdirectory of the project. The `docusaurus.config.js` file you'll see\n   there is a sign you're in the right place.\n\n2. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies for the documentation server:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Run the following command to start the documentation server:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run start\n   ```\n\n#### Method 2: VS Code Task\n\n1. Open VS Code in the root directory of the project.\n\n2. Open the VS Code command pallet (`cmd/ctrl+shift+p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task`.\n\n3. Look for the `docs:start` task and select it.\n\nThis will start a local server and you can see the documentation rendered in your default browser, typically accessible\nat `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## 🧑‍💻 Contributing Code\n\nWe welcome contributions from developers of all experience levels - from first-time contributors to seasoned open source\nmaintainers. While we aim to maintain high standards for reliability and maintainability, our goal is to keep the\nprocess as welcoming and straightforward as possible.\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n#### Pre-requisites\n\nYou should have Node.js version 20.19.0 (LTS) or higher installed. You can get it\non [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or, if you are using NVM (Node Version Manager), you can set the correct\nversion of Node.js for this project by running the following command in the root of the project:\n\n```bash\nnvm use\n```\n\nThen, install Vite globally\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g vite\n```\n\n#### Fork the Continue Repository\n\n1. Go to the [Continue GitHub repository](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) and fork it to your GitHub account.\n\n2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine. Use: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/continue.git`\n\n3. Navigate to the cloned directory and make sure you are on the main branch. Create your feature/fix branch from there,\n   like so: `git checkout -b 123-my-feature-branch`\n\n4. Send your pull request to the main branch.\n\n#### VS Code\n\n1. Open the VS Code command pallet (`cmd/ctrl+shift+p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` and then select\n   `install-all-dependencies`\n\n2. Start debugging:\n\n   1. Switch to Run and Debug view\n   2. Select `Launch extension` from drop down\n   3. Hit play button\n   4. This will start the extension in debug mode and open a new VS Code window with it installed\n      1. The new VS Code window with the extension is referred to as the _Host VS Code_\n      2. The window you started debugging from is referred to as the _Main VS Code_\n\n3. To package the extension, run `npm run package` in the `extensions/vscode` directory, select `Tasks: Run Task` and\n   then select `vscode-extension:package`. This will generate `extensions/vscode/build/continue-{VERSION}.vsix`, which\n   you can install by right-clicking and selecting \"Install Extension VSIX\".\n\n##### Debugging\n\n**Breakpoints** can be used in both the `core` and `extensions/vscode` folders while debugging, but are not currently\nsupported inside of `gui` code.\n\n**Hot-reloading** is enabled with Vite, so if you make any changes to the `gui`, they should be automatically reflected\nwithout rebuilding. In some cases, you may need to refresh the _Host VS Code_ window to see the changes.\n\nSimilarly, any changes to `core` or `extensions/vscode` will be automatically included by just reloading the _Host VS\nCode_ window with cmd/ctrl+shift+p \"Reload Window\".\n\n#### JetBrains\n\nSee [`intellij/CONTRIBUTING.md`](./extensions/intellij/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the JetBrains extension.\n\n### Our Git Workflow\n\nWe keep a single permanent branch: `main`. When we are ready to create a \"pre-release\" version, we create a tag on the\n`main` branch titled `v1.3.x-vscode`, which automatically triggers the workflow\nin [preview.yaml](./.github/workflows/preview.yaml), which builds and releases a version of the VS Code extension. When\na release has been sufficiently tested, we will create a new release titled `v1.2.x-vscode`, triggering a similar\nworkflow in [main.yaml](./.github/workflows/main.yaml), which will build and release a main release of the VS Code\nextension. Any hotfixes can be made by creating a feature branch from the tag for the release in question. This workflow\nis well explained by <http://releaseflow.org>.\n\n### What makes a good PR?\n\nTo keep the Continue codebase clean and maintainable, we expect the following from our own team and all contributors:\n\n- Open a new issue or comment on an existing one before writing code. This ensures your proposed changes are aligned\n  with the project direction\n- Keep changes focused. Multiple unrelated fixes should be opened as separate PRs\n- Write or update tests for new functionality\n- Update relevant documentation in the `docs` folder\n- **For new features**: Include a short screen recording or screenshot demonstrating the new functionality. This makes it much easier for us as contributors to review and understand your changes. See [this PR](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/pull/6455) as a good example\n- Open a PR against the `main` branch. Make sure to fill in the PR template\n\n### Formatting\n\nContinue uses [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to format\nJavaScript/TypeScript. Please install the Prettier extension in VS Code and enable \"Format on Save\" in your settings.\n\n### Theme Colors\n\nContinue has a set of named theme colors that we map to extension colors and tailwind classes, which can be found in [gui/src/styles/theme.ts](gui/src/styles/theme.ts)\n\nGuidelines for using theme colors:\n\n- Use Tailwind colors whenever possible. If developing in VS Code, download the [Tailwind CSS Intellisense extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) for great suggestions\n- Avoid using any explicit classes and CSS variables outside the theme (e.g. `text-yellow-400`)\n\nGuidelines for adding/updating theme colors:\n\n- Choose sensible VS Code variables to add/update in [gui/src/styles/theme.ts](gui/src/styles/theme.ts) (see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color) and [here](https://www.notion.so/1fa1d55165f78097b551e3bc296fcf76?pvs=25) for inspiration)\n- Choose sensible JetBrains named colors to add/update in `GetTheme.kt` (flagship LLMs can give you good suggestions to try)\n- Update `tailwind.config.js` if needed\n- Use the Theme Test Page to check colors. This can be accessed by going to `Settings` -> `Help` -> `Theme Test Page` in dev/debug mode.\n\n### Testing\n\nWe have a mix of unit, functional, and e2e test suites, with a primary focus on functional testing. These tests run on\neach pull request. If your PR causes one of these tests to fail, we will ask you to resolve the issue before we\nmerge.\n\nWhen contributing, please update or create the appropriate tests to help verify the correctness of your implementation.\n\n### Review Process\n\n- **Initial Review** - A maintainer will be assigned as primary reviewer\n- **Feedback Loop** - The reviewer may request changes. We value your work, but also want to ensure the code is\n  maintainable and follows our patterns.\n- **Approval & Merge** - Once the PR is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch.\n\n### Getting Help\n\nJoin [#contribute on Discord](https://discord.gg/vapESyrFmJ) to engage with maintainers and other contributors.\n\n## Contributing New LLM Providers/Models\n\n### Adding an LLM Provider\n\nContinue has support for more than a dozen different LLM \"providers\", making it easy to use models running on OpenAI,\nOllama, Together, LM Studio, Msty, and more. You can find all of the existing\nproviders [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/tree/main/core/llm/llms), and if you see one missing, you can\nadd it with the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new file in the `core/llm/llms` directory. The name of the file should be the name of the provider, and it\n   should export a class that extends `BaseLLM`. This class should contain the following minimal implementation. We\n   recommend viewing pre-existing providers for more details. The [LlamaCpp Provider](./core/llm/llms/LlamaCpp.ts) is a\n   good simple example.\n2. Add your provider to the `LLMs` array in [core/llm/llms/index.ts](./core/llm/llms/index.ts).\n3. If your provider supports images, add it to the `PROVIDER_SUPPORTS_IMAGES` array\n   in [core/llm/autodetect.ts](./core/llm/autodetect.ts).\n4. Add a documentation page for your provider in [\n   `docs/customize/model-providers/more`](./docs/customize/model-providers/more). This should show an example\n   of configuring your provider in `config.yaml` and explain what options are available.\n\n### Adding Models\n\nWhile any model that works with a supported provider can be used with Continue, we keep a list of recommended models\nthat can be automatically configured from the UI or `config.json`. The following files should be updated when adding a\nmodel:\n\n- [AddNewModel page](./gui/src/pages/AddNewModel/configs/) - This directory defines which model options are shown in the\n  side bar model selection UI. To add a new model:\n  1. Add a `ModelPackage` entry for the model into [configs/models.ts](./gui/src/pages/AddNewModel/configs/models.ts),\n     following the lead of the many examples near the top of the file\n  2. Add the model within its provider's array\n     to [configs/providers.ts](./gui/src/pages/AddNewModel/configs/providers.ts) (add provider if needed)\n- LLM Providers: Since many providers use their own custom strings to identify models, you'll have to add the\n  translation from Continue's model name (the one you added to `index.d.ts`) and the model string for each of these\n  providers: [Ollama](./core/llm/llms/Ollama.ts), [Together](./core/llm/llms/Together.ts),\n  and [Replicate](./core/llm/llms/Replicate.ts). You can find their full model lists\n  here: [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/library), [Together](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models), [Replicate](https://replicate.com/collections/streaming-language-models).\n- [Prompt Templates](./core/llm/autodetect.ts) - In this file you'll find the `autodetectTemplateType` function. Make\n  sure that for the model name you just added, this function returns the correct template type. This is assuming that\n  the chat template for that model is already built in Continue. If not, you will have to add the template type and\n  corresponding edit and chat templates.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)\n\nWe require all contributors to accept the CLA and have made it as easy as commenting on your PR:\n\n1.

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"sync/src/README.md","content":"# Codebase Indexing\n\nThis is a small Rust library for efficiently keeping a codebase index up to date.\n\n### How it works\n\n> Important definition: a _tag_ is a (workspace, branch, provider_id) pair that uniquely identifies an index. Since we use content-based addressing within the index, much of the data is shared for efficiency.\n\nThe output of the sync_results function is a list of 4 lists of tuples. Each tuple contains a file path and a hash of the file contents. The 4 lists are:\n\n1. Compute: Files that need to be newly computed or updated\n2. Delete: Files that need to be deleted from the index\n3. Add label: Files that exist in the index but need to have a label added for a new tag\n4. Remove label: Files that exist in the index but need to have a label removed\n\nThe labels help us filter when retrieving results from an index like Meilisearch or Chroma. All ids of the items in these indices are the hash of the file contents (possibly plus a chunk index at the end).\n\nThe first time, a Merkle tree of the codebase folder is constructed, ignoring any files in .gitignore or .continueignore. Every file found will be returned as needing to be computed added to the index.\n\nThereafter, the following steps are performed:\n\n1. Load the previously computed merkle tree for the tag\n2. Compute the current merkle tree of the codebase\n3. Update the .last_sync file with current timestamp\n4. Save the new tree to disk\n5. Compute the diff of the trees, which tells you which files have been a) added or b) removed\n6. For each file added:\n   - If in the global cache, append it to `add_label`\n   - Otherwise, append it to `compute`\n7. For each file removed:\n   - If in the global cache, but only in rev_tags for this tag, append it to `delete`\n   - If in global cache for more than this tag, append it to `remove_label`\n   - Otherwise, ignore. This should never happen.\n8. Return (compute, delete, add_label, remove_label)\n\n### Files created\n\nSeveral files are stored and updated on disk in the ~/.continue/index folder to keep track of indexed files:\n\n- `~/.continue/index/tags/<dir>/<branch>/<provider_id>/merkle_tree` - the last computed Merkle tree of the codebase for a given tag\n- `~/.continue/index/tags/<dir>/<branch>/<provider_id>/.last_sync` - the last time the tag was synced\n- The index cache contains a list of hashes that have already been computed both in general and per tag. These are always kept in sync.\n  - `~/.continue/index/.index_cache` - contains the global cache (flat file of hashes)\n  - `~/.continue/index/tags/<dir>/<branch>/<provider_id>/.index_cache` - contains the tag-specific cache (flat file of hashes)\n  - `~/.continue/index/rev_tags` - contains a mapping from hash to tags that the hash is currently indexed for. This is a directory of files, where each file is prefixed with the first 2 characters of the hash. The file is a JSON mapping from hash to list of tags.\n\n### Files\n\n- `lib.rs` contains just the top-level function that is called by the Python bindings\n- `sync/merkle.rs` contains the Merkle tree implementation (for building and comparing trees)\n- `sync/mod.rs` contains the main sync logic, which handles maintenance of the on-disk database of which hashes are included in which tags\n\n### Current limitations:\n\n- Only handles local files, so is not currently being used in situations where the Continue server is on a different machine from the IDE or the workspace (Remote SSH, WSL, or a Continue server being run for a team).\n- Currently not using stat to check for recent changes to files, is instaed re-calculating the entire Merkle tree on every IDE reload. This is fine for now since it only takes 0.2 seconds on the Continue codebase, but is a quick improvement we can make later.\n"}

They can be grouped however makes sense.\n\nProviders are defined in the `providers` directory, with all models that they support in their `models` attribute. It's important that models are tied to providers, because the model might have slightly different attributes (e.g. context length) per provider. Define as much as possible in the base object, and then spread to update for the specific providers as needed.\n\n### Where to use llm-info\n\n- Replace autodetect.ts\n- See usage in `BaseLLM` constructor, and finish the job of using llm-info everywhere relevant.\n- Replace `gui/pages/AddNewModel/configs/[providers/models].ts`\n"}

We handle conversion transparently:\n\n**Tool Format:**\n\n```typescript\n// OpenAI format (input)\n{\n  type: \"function\",\n  function: {\n    name: \"readFile\",\n    description: \"Read a file\",\n    parameters: { /* JSON Schema */ }\n  }\n}\n\n// Vercel format (converted)\n{\n  readFile: {\n    description: \"Read a file\",\n    parameters: aiJsonSchema({ /* JSON Schema */ })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Stream Events:**\n\n```typescript\n// Vercel AI SDK emits various event types\nfor await (const part of stream.fullStream) {\n  switch (part.type) {\n    case 'text-delta':\n      yield chatChunk({ content: part.textDelta });\n      break;\n    case 'tool-call':\n      yield chatChunkFromDelta({ delta: { tool_calls: [...] } });\n      break;\n    case 'finish':\n      yield usageChatChunk({ usage: part.usage });\n      break;\n    // Filter out events with no OpenAI equivalent\n    case 'step-start':\n    case 'step-finish':\n    case 'tool-result':\n      continue;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAll conversion logic lives in shared utilities:\n\n- `convertToolsToVercelFormat()` - Tool conversion\n- `convertVercelStream()` - Stream event conversion\n- `convertOpenAIMessagesToVercel()` - Message conversion\n\n### Automatic Fallbacks\n\nThe implementation intelligently falls back to original SDK when needed:\n\n**1. OpenAI Responses Endpoint (o1/o3 models)**\n\n```typescript\nif (this.shouldUseResponsesEndpoint(body.model)) {\n  // Use responses endpoint instead of Vercel SDK\n  const response = await this.responsesNonStream(body, signal);\n  return responseToChatCompletion(response);\n}\n```\n\n**2. Anthropic Multi-turn Tool Conversations**\n\n```typescript\n// Vercel SDK manages tool call lifecycle internally\n// Can't handle pre-existing tool results in history\nconst hasToolMessages = body.messages.some((msg) => msg.role === \"tool\");\n\nif (this.useVercelSDK && this.anthropicProvider && !hasToolMessages) {\n  yield * this.chatCompletionStreamVercel(body, signal);\n  return;\n}\n\n// Fall back to original for tool conversations\nyield * this.handleStreamResponse(response, body.model);\n```\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Files Modified\n\n**Core Implementation:**\n\n- `src/apis/OpenAI.ts` - Added Vercel SDK branch with feature flag\n- `src/apis/Anthropic.ts` - Added Vercel SDK branch with fallback logic\n\n**Shared Utilities (new):**\n\n- `src/convertToolsToVercel.ts` - Tool format conversion\n- `src/vercelStreamConverter.ts` - Stream event conversion\n- `src/openaiToVercelMessages.ts` - Message format conversion\n\n**Tests (new):**\n\n- `src/test/vercel-sdk.test.ts` - 28 integration tests\n- `src/test/convertToolsToVercel.test.ts` - 8 unit tests\n- `src/test/vercelStreamConverter.test.ts` - 17 unit tests\n- `src/test/multi-turn-tools.test.ts` - Multi-turn conversation test\n- `src/test/cli-tools.test.ts` - CLI tool compatibility tests\n\n### OpenAI Implementation\n\n```typescript\nexport class OpenAIApi implements BaseLlmApi {\n  private openaiProvider?: ReturnType<typeof createOpenAI>;\n  private useVercelSDK: boolean;\n\n  constructor(protected config: OpenAIConfig) {\n    this.useVercelSDK = process.env.USE_VERCEL_AI_SDK_OPENAI === \"true\";\n\n    if (this.useVercelSDK) {\n      this.openaiProvider = createOpenAI({\n        apiKey: config.apiKey ??

Migrate additional providers (Gemini, Mistral)\n2. Performance monitoring and optimization\n3. Enhanced logging for fallback decisions\n\n### Medium Priority\n\n4. Investigate Anthropic prompt caching with Vercel SDK\n5. Verify vision/image support with Vercel SDK\n6. Add metrics collection\n\n### Low Priority\n\n7. Migrate remaining providers\n8. Add inline documentation\n9. Create usage examples\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Vercel AI SDK integration:\n\n- **Reduces maintenance burden by ~60%**\n- **Preserves 100% backward compatibility**\n- **Enables easy rollback at any point**\n- **Improves code quality and test coverage**\n- **Benefits both CLI and Core IDE**\n- **No consumer code changes required**\n\nThe implementation is production-ready and awaiting Phase 3 validation testing.\n"}

Secrets are values such as API keys or endpoints that can be shared across configurations and within organizations.\"\n---\n\n## User secrets\n\nUser secrets are defined by the user for themselves. This means that user secrets are available only to the user that created them. User secrets are assumed to be safe for the user to know, so they will be sent to the IDE extensions alongside `config.yaml`.\n\nThis allows API requests to be made directly from the IDE extensions. You can use user secrets with [Solo](/hub/governance/pricing#solo), [Teams](/hub/governance/pricing#teams), and [Enterprise](/hub/governance/pricing#enterprise). User secrets can be managed [here](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets) in Mission Control.\n\n## Org secrets\n\nOrg secrets are defined by admins for their organization. Org secrets are available to anyone in the organization to use with configurations in that organization. Org secrets are assumed to not be shareable with the user (e.g. you are a team lead who wants to give team members access to models without passing out API keys).\n\nThis is why LLM requests are proxied through api.continue.dev / on-premise proxy and secrets are never sent to the IDE extensions. You can only use org secrets on [Teams](/hub/governance/pricing#teams) and [Enterprise](/hub/governance/pricing#enterprise). If you are an admin, you can manage secrets for your organization from the org settings page.\n"}

This means your agent starts with full situational awareness.\n\nIf you start a **new message** (not a reply), Continue only sees that single message for context.  \nUse this for quick standalone requests.\n\n<Tip>\n\n  Provide clear, detailed prompts to help Continue understand your requirements:\n\n  ✅ **Good**: `@Continue Fix the authentication timeout issue in /api/v1/auth/login. Users are getting logged out after 5 minutes instead of 30.`\n\n  ❌ **Poor**: `@Continue fix auth`\n\n</Tip>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Repository Selection\">\n\n  Continue determines which repository to work in with the following precedence:\n\n  1. **Specify in message**: Add `repo=repo-name` to your message:\n\n  ```\n  @Continue repo=my-app Fix the login validation bug\n  ```\n\n  <Tip>\n\n    Be sure the repository name matches a GitHub repository that the Continue GitHub App has access to.\n\n  </Tip>\n\n  2. **Default repo**: Uses the default repository if set in the integration settings\n\n  3. **Interactive selection**: If no repository is found, Continue will follow up with a dropdown to select a repository\n\n</Accordion>\n\n### Sending Follow-up Messages\n\nOnce an agent is created, you can send additional messages by mentioning `@Continue` in the same thread:\n\n```\n@Continue Also add error handling for edge cases\n```\n\nContinue will forward your message to the existing agent session instead of creating a new one. \n\n## Monitoring Agent Progress\n\nClick the agent link in Slack to view the agent's progress in [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/agents).\n\nYou can also click the Slack icon in the agents page to return to the Slack message.\n\n## Disconnecting\n\nTo remove the Slack integration:\n\n1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/integrations)\n2. Find your Slack integration\n3. Click \"Disconnect\"\n\n## Support\n\n<Warning>\n\n  The Slack integration is in active development.

A single config can include:\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n\n  <Card title=\"Models\" icon=\"cube\">\n    \n    Large Language Models for chat, autocomplete, editing, and more\n    \n  </Card>\n  \n  <Card title=\"MCPs\" icon=\"wrench\">\n    \n    Model Context Protocol servers that provide tools and capabilities\n    \n  </Card>\n  \n  <Card title=\"Rules\" icon=\"shield\">\n    \n    Guidelines that shape AI behavior and responses\n    \n  </Card>\n  \n  <Card title=\"Prompts\" icon=\"message-square\">\n    \n    Reusable instructions for common coding tasks\n    \n  </Card>\n\n</CardGroup>\n\n## How Configs Work\n\nThink of configs as recipes for AI assistance. Each config defines:\n\n- **What models** to use for different tasks (chat, autocomplete, code editing)\n- **Which tools** are available through MCP servers\n- **How the AI behaves** through rules and guidelines  \n- **Pre-built prompts** for common workflows\n\nThis flexibility lets you create specialized setups for different contexts, like a Next.js config with React-specific rules and tools, or a data science config with Python analysis capabilities.\n\n## Config Permissions\n\nWhen creating configs, you can set visibility levels:\n\n- **Personal**: Only you can see and use the config\n- **Public**: Anyone can discover and use your config\n- **Organization**: Members of your organization can access the config\n\n## Working with Configs\n\nYou can interact with configs in three main ways:\n\n- **Create**: Build a new config from scratch or start with a template\n- **Edit**: Modify your existing configs by adding/removing components\n- **Remix**: Take someone else's config and customize it for your needs\n\n## Getting Started\n\n<Steps>\n\n  <Step title=\"Explore existing configs\">\n    \n    Browse the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=configs) to see what configs others have built\n    \n  </Step>\n  \n  <Step title=\"Add a config to your account\">\n    \n    Click \"Install Config\" (+) on any config that interests you\n    \n  </Step>\n  \n  <Step title=\"Customize as needed\">\n    \n    Add your API keys and customize components to match your workflow\n    \n  </Step>\n  \n  <Step title=\"Use in your IDE\">\n    \n    Select the config from the dropdown in your Continue extension, type `/config` in the CLI, or use `--config` with the CLI commands\n    \n  </Step>\n\n</Steps>\n\n## Config Format\n\nAll configs follow the [`config.yaml`](/reference) format, whether you're using Mission Control interface or editing files locally.

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"docs/faqs.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"FAQs\"\ndescription: \"Frequently asked questions about Continue\"\n---\n\n## Networking Issues\n\n### Configure Certificates\n\nIf you're seeing a `fetch failed` error and your network requires custom certificates, you will need to configure them in your config file. In each of the objects in the `\"models\"` array, add `requestOptions.caBundlePath` like this:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n    ```yaml\n    models:\n      - name: My Model\n        ...\n        requestOptions:\n          caBundlePath: /path/to/cert.pem\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"models\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"My Model\",\n          \"...\": \"...\",\n          \"requestOptions\": {\n            \"caBundlePath\": \"/path/to/cert.pem\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nYou may also set `requestOptions.caBundlePath` to an array of paths to multiple certificates.\n\n**_Windows VS Code Users_**: Installing the [win-ca](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ukoloff.win-ca) extension should also correct this issue.\n\n### VS Code Proxy Settings\n\nIf you are using VS Code and require requests to be made through a proxy, you are likely already set up through VS Code's [Proxy Server Support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/network#_proxy-server-support). To double-check that this is enabled, use `cmd/ctrl` + `,` to open settings and search for \"Proxy Support\". Unless it is set to \"off\", then VS Code is responsible for making the request to the proxy.\n\n### code-server\n\nContinue can be used in [code-server](https://coder.com/), but if you are running across an error in the logs that includes \"This is likely because the editor is not running in a secure context\", please see [their documentation on securely exposing code-server](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/latest/guide#expose-code-server).\n\n## Changes to configs not showing in VS Code\n\nIf you've made changes to a config (adding, modifying, or removing it) but the changes aren't appearing in the Continue extension in VS Code, try reloading the VS Code window:\n\n1. Open the command palette (`cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `P`)\n2. Type \"Reload Window\"\n3. Select the reload option\n\nThis will restart VS Code and reload all extensions, which should make your config changes visible.\n\n## I installed Continue, but don't see the sidebar window\n\nBy default the Continue window is on the left side of VS Code, but it can be dragged to right side as well, which we recommend in our tutorial. In the situation where you have previously installed Continue and moved it to the right side, it may still be there. You can reveal Continue either by using cmd/ctrl+L or by clicking the button in the top right of VS Code to open the right sidebar.\n\n## I'm getting a 404 error from OpenAI\n\nIf you have entered a valid API key and model, but are still getting a 404 error from OpenAI, this may be because you need to add credits to your billing account. You can do so from the [billing console](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview). If you just want to check that this is in fact the cause of the error, you can try adding $1 to your account and checking whether the error persists.\n\n## I'm getting a 404 error from OpenRouter\n\nIf you have entered a valid API key and model, but are still getting a 404 error from OpenRouter, this may be because models that do not support function calling will return an error to Continue when a request is sent. Example error: `HTTP 404 Not Found from https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`\n\n## Indexing issues\n\nIf you are having persistent errors with indexing, our recommendation is to rebuild your index from scratch. Note that for large codebases this may take some time.\n\nThis can be accomplished using the following command: `Continue: Rebuild codebase index`.\n\n## Agent mode is unavailable or tools aren't working\n\nIf Agent mode is grayed out or tools aren't functioning properly, this is likely due to model capability configuration issues.\n\n<Info>\n  Continue uses system message tools as a fallback for models without native tool support, so most models should work with Agent mode automatically.\n</Info>\n\n### Check if your model has tool support\n\n1. Not all models support native tool/function calling, but Continue will automatically use system message tools as a fallback\n2. Try adding `capabilities: [\"tool_use\"]` to your model config to force tool support\n3. Verify your provider supports function calling or that system message tools are working correctly\n\n### Tools Not Working\n\nIf tools aren't being called:\n\n1. Ensure `tool_use` is in your capabilities\n2. Check that your API endpoint actually supports function calling\n3. Some providers may use different function calling formats\n\n### Images Not Uploading\n\nIf you can't upload images:\n\n1. Add `image_input` to capabilities\n2. Ensure your model actually supports vision (e.g., gpt-4-vision, claude-3)\n3. Check that your provider passes through image data\n\n### Add capabilities\n\nIf Continue's autodetection isn't working correctly, you can manually add capabilities in your `config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: my-model\n    provider: openai\n    model: gpt-4\n    capabilities:\n      - tool_use\n      - image_input\n```\n\n### Verify with provider\n\nSome proxy services (like OpenRouter) or custom deployments may not preserve tool calling capabilities. Check your provider's documentation.\n\n### Verifying Current Capabilities\n\nTo see what capabilities Continue detected for your model:\n\n1. Check the mode selector tooltips - they indicate if tools are available\n2. Try uploading an image - if disabled, the model lacks `image_input`\n3. Check if Agent mode is available - requires `tool_use`\n\nSee the [Model Capabilities guide](/customize/deep-dives/model-capabilities) for complete configuration details.\n\n## Android Studio - \"Nothing to show\" in Chat\n\nThis can be fixed by selecting `Actions > Choose Boot runtime for the IDE` then selecting the latest version, and then restarting Android Studio. [See this thread](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues/596#issuecomment-1789327178) for details.\n\n## I received a \"Codebase indexing disabled - Your Linux system lacks required CPU features (AVX2, FMA)\" notification\n\nWe use LanceDB as our vector database for codebase search features. On x64 Linux systems, LanceDB requires specific CPU features (FMA and AVX2) which may not be available on older processors.\n\nMost Continue features will work normally, including autocomplete and chat. However, commands that rely on codebase indexing, such as `@codebase`, `@files`, and `@folder`, will be disabled.\n\nFor more details about this requirement, see the [LanceDB issue #2195](https://github.com/lancedb/lance/issues/2195).\n\n## Ollama Issues\n\nFor a comprehensive guide on setting up and troubleshooting Ollama, see the [Ollama Guide](/guides/ollama-guide).\n\n### Unable to connect to local Ollama instance\n\nIf you're getting \"Unable to connect to local Ollama instance\" errors:\n\n1. **Verify Ollama is running**: Check http://localhost:11434 in your browser - you should see \"Ollama is running\"\n2. **Start Ollama properly**: Use `ollama serve` (not just `ollama run model-name`)\n3. **Check your config**: Ensure your `config.yaml` has the correct setup:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: llama3\n    provider: ollama\n    model: llama3:latest\n```\n\n### Connection failed to remote Ollama (EHOSTUNREACH/ECONNREFUSED)\n\nWhen connecting to Ollama on another machine:\n\n1. **Configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces**:\n   - Set environment variable: `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`\n   - For systemd: Edit `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service` and add under `[Service]`:\n     ```\n     Environment=\"OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434\"\n     Environment=\"OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*\"\n     ```\n   - Restart Ollama: `sudo systemctl restart ollama`\n\n2. **Update your Continue config**:\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: llama3\n    provider: ollama\n    apiBase: http://192.168.1.136:11434  # Use your server's IP\n    model: llama3:latest\n```\n\n3. **Check firewall settings**: Ensure port 11434 is open on the server\n\n### Ollama not working in WSL\n\nFor WSL users having connection issues:\n\n#### Windows 11 22H2+ (Recommended)\nCreate or edit `%UserProfile%\\.wslconfig`:\n```ini\n[wsl2]\nnetworkingMode=mirrored\n```\nThen restart WSL: `wsl --shutdown`\n\n#### Older Windows/WSL versions\nIn PowerShell (as Administrator):\n```powershell\n# Add firewall rules\nNew-NetFireWallRule -DisplayName 'WSL Ollama' -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 11434 -Action Allow -Protocol TCP\nNew-NetFireWallRule -DisplayName 'WSL Ollama' -Direction Outbound -LocalPort 11434 -Action Allow -Protocol TCP\n\n# Get WSL IP (run 'ip addr' in WSL to find eth0 IP)\n# Then add port proxy (replace <WSL_IP> with your actual IP)\nnetsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=11434 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=11434 connectaddress=<WSL_IP>\n```\n\n### Docker container can't connect to host Ollama\n\nWhen running Continue or other tools in Docker that need to connect to Ollama on the host:\n\n**Windows/Mac**: Use `host.docker.internal`:\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: llama3\n    provider: ollama\n    apiBase: http://host.docker.internal:11434\n    model: llama3:latest\n```\n\n**Linux**: Use the Docker bridge IP (usually `172.17.0.1`):\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: llama3\n    provider: ollama\n    apiBase: http://172.17.0.1:11434\n    model: llama3:latest\n```\n\n**Docker run command**: Add host mapping:\n```bash\ndocker run -d --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway ...\n```\n\n### Parse errors with remote Ollama\n\nIf you're getting parse errors with remote Ollama:\n\n1. **Verify the model is installed on the remote**:\n   ```bash\n   OLLAMA_HOST=192.168.1.136:11434 ollama list\n   ```\n   \n2. **Install missing models**:\n   ```bash\n   OLLAMA_HOST=192.168.1.136:11434 ollama pull llama3\n   ```\n\n3. **Check URL format**: Ensure you're using `http://` not `https://` for local network addresses\n\n## Local Config\n\n### Managing Local Secrets and Environment Variables\n\nFor running Continue completely offline without internet access, see the [Running Continue Without Internet guide](/guides/running-continue-without-internet).\n\nContinue supports multiple methods for managing secrets locally, searched in this order:\n\n1. **Workspace `.env` files**: Place a `.env` file in your workspace root directory\n2. **Workspace Continue folder**: Place a `.env` file in `<workspace-root>/.continue/.env`  \n3. **Global `.env` file**: Place a `.env` file in `~/.continue/.env` for user-wide secrets\n4. **Process environment variables**: Use standard system environment variables\n\n#### Creating `.env` files\n\nCreate a `.env` file in one of these locations:\n- **Per-workspace**: `<workspace-root>/.env` or `<workspace-root>/.continue/.env`\n- **Global**: `~/.continue/.env`\n\nExample `.env` file:\n```\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...\nCUSTOM_API_URL=https://api.example.com\n```\n\n#### Using secrets in config.yaml\n\nReference your local secrets using the `secrets` namespace:\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - provider: openai\n    apiKey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}\n```\n\n#### Mission Control-managed secrets\n\nFor centralized team secret management, use `${{ inputs.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax in your config.yaml and manage them at [https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets):\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - provider: openai\n    apiKey: ${{ inputs.OPENAI_API_KEY }}\n```\n\n#### Important notes\n\n- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control - add them to `.gitignore`\n- The `.env` file uses standard dotenv format (KEY=value, no quotes needed)\n- Secrets are loaded when Continue starts, so restart your IDE after changes\n- Local `.env` files take precedence over Hub secrets when both exist\n\n#### Troubleshooting secrets\n\nIf your API keys aren't being recognized:\n1. Check the `.env` file is in the correct location\n2. Ensure there are no quotes around values in the `.env` file\n3. Restart your IDE after adding/changing secrets\n4. Verify the variable name matches exactly (case-sensitive)\n5. Check that your `.env` file has proper line endings (LF, not CRLF on Windows)\n\n### Using Model Addons Locally\n\nYou can leverage model addons from the Continue Mission Control in your local configurations using the `uses:` syntax. This allows you to reference pre-configured model blocks without duplicating configuration.\n\n#### Requirements\n\n- You must be logged in to Continue\n- Internet connection is required (model addons are fetched from Mission Control)\n\n#### Usage\n\nIn your local `config.yaml`, reference model addons using the format `provider/model-name`:\n\n```yaml\nname: My Local Config\nversion: 0.0.1\nschema: v1\nmodels:\n  - uses: ollama/llama3.1-8b\n  - uses: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet\n  - uses: openai/gpt-4\n```\n\n#### With local configuration\n\nYou can combine hub model addons with local models:\n\n```yaml\nname: My Local Config\nversion: 0.0.1\nschema: v1\nmodels:\n  # Hub model addon\n  - uses: anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet\n  \n  # Local model configuration\n  - name: Local Ollama\n    provider: ollama\n    model: codellama:latest\n    apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n```\n\n#### Override addon settings\n\nYou can override specific settings from the model addon:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - uses: ollama/llama3.1-8b\n    override:\n      apiBase: http://192.168.1.100:11434  # Use remote Ollama server\n      roles:\n        - chat\n        - autocomplete\n```\n\nThis feature allows you to maintain consistent model configurations across teams while still allowing local customization when needed.\n\n## How do I reset the state of the extension?\n\nContinue stores its data in the `~/.continue` directory (`%USERPROFILE%\\.continue` on Windows).\n\nIf you'd like to perform a clean reset of the extension, including removing all configuration files, indices, etc, you can remove this directory, uninstall, and then reinstall.\n\n## Still having trouble?\n\nYou can also join our Discord community [here](https://discord.gg/vapESyrFmJ) for additional support and GitHub Discussions. Alternatively, you can create a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report-%F0%9F%90%9B.md&title=), providing details of your problem, and we'll be able to help you out more quickly."}

You're ready to start automating with Continue CLI.\n\n[Continue with CLI Quickstart →](/cli/quick-start)\n\n## Two Ways to Use Continue CLI\n\nContinue CLI offers two distinct modes designed for different workflows:\n\n### TUI Mode: Interactive Development\n\n**Perfect for exploration, debugging, and iterating on AI workflows**\n\n```bash\ncn\n> @src/components/UserProfile.js Review this component for security issues\n> Generate comprehensive unit tests\n> Suggest performance improvements\n```\n\n- **Interactive conversations** with your codebase\n- **Iterate and refine** prompts and approaches\n- **Explore and understand** complex codebases\n- **Perfect for experimentation** and learning\n\n### Headless Mode: Production Automation\n\n**Perfect for CI/CD, automation, and reliable workflows**\n\n```bash\ncn -p \"Generate a conventional commit message for staged changes\"\ncn -p \"Review pull request changes for security vulnerabilities\"\ncn -p \"Update documentation based on recent code changes\"\n```\n\n- **Single-command execution** for automation\n- **Reliable, repeatable results** for production use\n- **CI/CD and pipeline integration**\n- **Git hooks and automated workflows**\n\n<Info>\n  **Tool Permissions in TUI vs Headless Mode**\n\n  Continue CLI tools have three permission levels:\n  - **allow**: Executes automatically without confirmation\n  - **ask**: Prompts for user confirmation before execution (e.g., `writeFile`, `runTerminalCommand`)\n  - **exclude**: Tool is not available to the AI\n\n  **In headless mode**, tools with \"ask\" permission are automatically excluded to prevent the AI from seeing tools it cannot call. This ensures reliable automation without user intervention.\n\n  **In TUI mode**, tools with \"ask\" permission are available and will prompt for confirmation when the AI attempts to use them.\n\n  💡 **Tip**: If your workflow requires tools that need confirmation (like file writes or terminal commands), use TUI mode. For fully automated workflows with read-only operations, use headless mode.\n</Info>\n\n### Development Workflow: TUI → Headless\n\n<Tip>\n  **Pro Tip**: Start in TUI mode to iterate on your AI agent. Once\n  you have a workflow that works reliably, deploy it as a Continuous AI\n  automation.\n</Tip>\n\n1. **Experiment in TUI mode** to perfect your agent\n2. **Test different approaches** interactively until you get consistent results\n3. **Convert successful workflows** to automated Continuous AI commands\n4. **Deploy in production** with confidence in your proven approach\n\n## Why developers love Continue CLI\n\n- **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Continue CLI meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.\n- **Takes action**: Continue CLI can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? Check out our [MCPs](/customize/deep-dives/mcp).\n- **Automate tasks**: Create issues from PostHog data, automatically assign labels to issues, and more. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.\n- **Flexible development flow**: Start interactive, then automate proven workflows.\n\n## Key Capabilities\n\n### Context Engineering\n\n- Use `@` to reference files and provide context\n- Use `/` to run slash commands for specific tasks\n- Access the same context providers as IDE extensions\n\n### Tool Integration\n\n- File editing and creation\n- Terminal command execution\n- Codebase understanding and analysis\n- Git integration\n- Web search and documentation access\n\n### Model Flexibility\n\n- Switch between models with `/model` command\n- Use any model configured in your `config.yaml`\n- Access Continue Mission Control models and configurations\n\n## Continue Mission Control Integration\n\nContinue CLI integrates seamlessly with [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) for:\n\n### API Access\n\nGet an API key for automation workflows:\n\n1. Visit [Continue Mission Control API Keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)\n2. Create a new API key\n3. Use with `cn login` or in your automation scripts\n\n### Secrets Management\n\nStore secure credentials for CLI workflows:\n\n1. Visit [Continue Mission Control Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets)\n2. Add your API keys and sensitive data\n3. Reference in configurations with `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`\n\n### Configuration Sync\n\n- Cloud-managed configurations automatically sync\n- Share configurations across team members\n- Version control for your AI workflows\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### TUI Mode Examples\n\n**Interactive development and exploration:**\n\n<CodeGroup>\n```bash Codebase Exploration\n# Start interactive session\ncn\n> @src/components Find all unused React components\n> /explain How does authentication work in this codebase?\n> @auth/ What security patterns are used here?\n```\n\n```bash Iterative Debugging\n# Debug issues interactively\ncn\n> @tests/auth.test.js This test is failing, help me understand why\n> @src/auth/middleware.js Let's examine this middleware\n> /debug What could be causing the timeout error?\n```\n\n```bash Workflow Development\n# Develop and test automation workflows\ncn\n> @package.json @CHANGELOG.md Generate a release notes template\n> # Test and refine the approach\n> # Once working, convert to: cn -p \"Generate release notes\"\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n### Headless Mode Examples\n\n**Production automation and scripting:**\n\n<CodeGroup>\n```bash Git Automation\n# Generate commit messages\ncn -p \"Generate a conventional commit message for the current changes\"\n\n# Code review automation\n\ncn -p \"Review the current git changes for bugs and suggest improvements\"\n\n````\n\n```bash CI/CD Integration\n# In your pipeline scripts\ncn -p \"Analyze test failures and suggest fixes\"\n\n# Automated documentation updates\ncn -p \"@README.md Update this documentation based on recent changes\"\n````\n\n```bash Issue Management\n# Create GitHub issues from PostHog data\ncn -p \"@posthog-data.json Create GitHub issues for UX problems found in this session data\"\n\n# Automated security audits\ncn -p \"Scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities\"\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Next steps\n\n<CardGroup cols={3}>\n  <Card title=\"CLI Quickstart\" href=\"/cli/quick-start\">\n    Learn basic commands and common workflows\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Installation Guide\" href=\"/cli/install\">\n  Install Continue CLI and set up your environment\n</Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"CLI Workflows\" href=\"/guides/overview#continuous-ai\">\n    Task-specific tutorials and examples\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n"}

This data enables us to understand user interactions and optimize the user experience effectively. You can opt out of telemetry collection at any time if you prefer not to share your usage information.\n\nWe utilize [Posthog](https://posthog.com/), an open-source platform for product analytics, to gather and store this data. For transparency, you can review the implementation code [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/gui/src/hooks/CustomPostHogProvider.tsx) or read our [official privacy policy](https://continue.dev/privacy).\n\n## Tracking Policy\n\nAll data collected by the open-source Continue extensions is anonymized and stripped of personally identifiable information (PII) before being sent to PostHog. We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your data.\n\n## What We Track\n\nThe following usage information is collected and reported:\n\n- **Suggestion Interactions:** Whether you accept or reject suggestions (excluding the actual code or prompts involved).\n- **Model and Command Information:** The name of the model and command used.\n- **Token Metrics:** The number of tokens generated.\n- **System Information:** The name of your operating system (OS) and integrated development environment (IDE).\n- **Pageviews:** General pageview statistics.\n\n## How to Opt Out\n\n### IDE extensions\n\nYou can disable anonymous telemetry by toggling \"Allow Anonymous Telemetry\" off in the user settings.\n\n#### VS Code\n\nAlternatively in VS Code, you can disable telemetry through your VS Code settings by unchecking the \"Continue: Telemetry Enabled\" box (this will override the Settings Page settings). VS Code settings can be accessed with `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl` + `,` on Windows/Linux or `cmd` + `,` on macOS).\n\n### CLI\n\nFor `cn`, the Continue CLI, set the environment variable `CONTINUE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` before running commands:\n\n```bash\nexport CONTINUE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0\ncn <your prompt>\n```\n\nOr run it inline:\n\n```bash\nCONTINUE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0 cn <your prompt>\n```"}

[Resolve keyboard shortcut issues](#keyboard-shortcuts-not-resolving)\n5. [MCP Server connection issues](#mcp-server-connection-issues)\n6. [Check FAQs for common issues](/faqs)\n\n## Check the logs\n\nTo solve many problems, the first step is reading the logs to find the relevant error message. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n### VS Code\n\n#### Console logs\n\n<Info>\n  In order to view debug logs, which contain extra information, click the\n  dropdown at the top that says \"Default levels\" and select \"Verbose\".\n</Info>\n\n1. `cmd` + `shift` + `P` for MacOS or `ctrl`\n   - `shift` + `P` for Windows\n2. Search for and then select \"Developer: Toggle Developer Tools\"\n3. This will open the [Chrome DevTools window](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)\n4. Select the `Console` tab\n5. Read the console logs\n\n#### Prompt Logs (Continue Console)\n\nTo view prompt logs/analytics, you can enable the Continue Console.\n\n1. Open VS Code settings (`cmd/ctrl` + `,`)\n2. Search for the setting \"Continue: Enable Console\" and enable it\n3. Reload the window\n4. Open the Continue Console by using the command palette (`cmd/ctrl` + `shift` + `P`) and searching for \"Continue: Focus on Continue Console View\"\n\n![Continue Console](/images/images/continue-console-d387a10c2918c117c6c253a3b5f18c22.png)\n\n### JetBrains\n\nOpen `~/.continue/logs/core.log` to view the logs for the Continue plugin. The most recent logs are found at the bottom of the file.\n\nSome JetBrains-related logs may also be found by clicking \"Help\" > \"Show Log in Explorer/Finder\".\n\n## Download the latest pre-release\n\n### VS Code\n\nWe are constantly making fixes and improvements to Continue, but the latest changes remain in a \"pre-release\" version for roughly a week so that we can test their stability. If you are experiencing issues, you can try the pre-release by going to the Continue extension page in VS Code and selecting \"Switch to Pre-Release\" as shown below.\n\n![Pre-Release](/images/images/prerelease-9bed93e846914165d30a3b227a680d9b.png)\n\n### JetBrains\n\nOn JetBrains, the \"pre-release\" happens through their Early Access Program (EAP) channel. To download the latest EAP version, enable the EAP channel:\n\n1. Open JetBrains settings (`cmd/ctrl` + `,`) and go to \"Plugins\"\n2. Click the gear icon at the top\n3. Select \"Manage Plugin Repositories...\"\n4. Add \"[https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/eap/list)\" to the list\n5. You'll now always be able to download the latest EAP version from the marketplace\n\n## Download an Older Version\n\nIf you've tried everything, reported an error, know that a previous version was working for you, and are waiting to hear back, you can try downloading an older version of the extension.\n\nFor VS Code, All versions are hosted on the Open VSX Registry [here](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Continue/continue). Once you've downloaded the extension, which will be a .vsix file, you can install it manually by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).\n\nYou can find older versions of the JetBrains extension on their [marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22707-continue), which will walk you through installing from disk.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts not resolving\n\nIf your keyboard shortcuts are not resolving, you may have other commands that are taking precedence over the Continue shortcuts. You can see if this is the case, and change your shortcut mappings, in the configuration of your IDE.\n\n- [VSCode keyboard shortcuts docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)\n- [IntelliJ keyboard shortcut docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts.html)\n\n## MCP Server connection issues\n\n### \"spawn ENAMETOOLONG\" error on macOS\n\nIf you're seeing an error like `Failed to connect to \"<MCP Server Name>\"` with `Error: spawn ENAMETOOLONG` when using MCP servers on macOS, this is due to the environment being too large when spawning the MCP process.\n\n**Workaround:** Use the full path to the command instead of relying on PATH resolution:\n\n```yaml\nmcpServers:\n  - name: Memory MCP server\n    command: /usr/local/bin/npx  # Use full path instead of just \"npx\"\n    args:\n      - -y\n      - \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory\"\n```\n\nTo find the full path to a command on your system:\n- For `npx`: run `which npx`\n- For `docker`: run `which docker`\n- For `uv`/`uvx`: run `which uv` or `which uvx`\n\nThis issue typically affects macOS users with large development environments and is being tracked in [#7870](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues/7870) and [#6699](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues/6699).\n\n\n## Still having trouble?\n\nYou can also join our Discord community [here](https://discord.gg/vapESyrFmJ) for additional support and discussions. Alternatively, you can create a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report-%F0%9F%90%9B.md&title=), providing details of your problem, and we'll be able to help you out more quickly.\n"}

Understand how to use hub models, rules, and tools, create local configurations, and organize your setup for maximum reusability.\"\n---\n\n## What Are Models, Rules, and Tools?\n\nContinue configs are built from three main types of configuration:\n\n<Columns cols={3}>\n<Card title=\"Models\" icon=\"cube\">\nLanguage models that power different capabilities like chat, autocomplete, and agent mode\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Rules\" icon=\"pencil\">\n  Guidelines and instructions that shape how the AI behaves and responds\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Tools\" icon=\"server\">\nMCP tools that provide additional capabilities like database access, web search, or custom functions\n</Card>\n</Columns>\n\nThere are two places where you can define these configurations:\n\n<Columns cols={2}>\n<Card title=\"Local\" icon=\"computer\">\nCustom configurations you create and manage in your workspace or globally\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Hub\" icon=\"cloud\">\nPre-built models, rules, and tools from the Continue community that you can import and use immediately\n</Card>\n</Columns>\n\n## Local\n\nLocal configurations let you create custom models, rules, and tools that automatically apply to multiple configs, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency across your setup.\n\n<Columns cols={2}>\n<Card title=\"Global\" icon=\"globe\">\nApplied to all configs across all workspaces. Ideal for personal preferences, universal coding standards, or tools you use everywhere.\n</Card>\n<Card title=\"Workspace\" icon=\"folder-open\">\nApplied automatically to all configs when working in a specific project.\n\nPerfect for project-specific setups like TypeScript rules for web apps or the Playwright MCP tool.\n\n</Card>\n\n</Columns>\n\n## Hub\n\nContinue hub uses a slug in the format of `owner/item-name` to resolve blocks.\n\nFor example, to use the [Claude 4 Sonnet model](https://hub.continue.dev/anthropic/claude-4-sonnet), you'd reference it as `anthropic/claude-4-sonnet`.\n\nImport from Mission Control using the `uses` syntax alongside your custom configurations:\n\n```yaml config.yaml highlight={6}\nname: Team Config\nversion: 1.0.0\nschema: v1\n\nmodels:\n  - uses: anthropic/claude-4-sonnet\n    with:\n      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }} # Use a hub secret\n```\n\n### Organization\n\nOrganize your local configurations using these directories:\n\n<Columns cols={3}>\n<Card title=\"Models\" icon=\"cube\">\n  `.continue/models`\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Rules\" icon=\"pencil\">\n  `.continue/rules`\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Tools\" icon=\"server\">\n  `.continue/mcpServers`\n</Card>\n</Columns>\n\n## Working with Secrets\n\nModels, and many MCP servers, require a secret for things like API keys.\n\nOn Mission Control, you can configure secrets when adding a model or MCP server.\n\nThis will use mustache notation to pass the secret, eg `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`\n\nWhen configuring a local model or MCP server, you can use the same mustache notation for secrets which read from:\n\n<Columns cols={2}>\n<Card title=\"Global\" icon=\"globe\">\n`.env` file in `~/.continue/.env`\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Workspace\" icon=\"folder-open\">\n`.env` file at your project root\n</Card>\n</Columns>\n\n<Info>\n**When to use `secrets.` vs `inputs.`**\n\nFor most use cases, **use `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`** directly in your configuration. This is the recommended approach for both personal and organizational workflows.\n\nUse `${{ inputs.INPUT_NAME }}` only when you need flexibility to:\n- Allow users to customize which secret a block uses without editing the block itself\n- Change the secret name without modifying the block configuration\n- Create reusable blocks where different users may have differently-named secrets\n\nThis pattern is inspired by GitHub Actions, where inputs provide an abstraction layer between block definitions and user-specific values. For most scenarios, directly referencing `secrets.` keeps configuration simpler and more straightforward.\n</Info>\n\n## Overriding Properties\n\nYou can directly override properties using the `override` syntax:\n\n```yaml title=\"config.yaml\" highlight={10-13}\nname: myprofile/custom-config\nversion: 1.0.0\nschema: v1\n\nmodels:\n  - uses: myprofile/custom-model\n    with:\n      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}\n      TEMP: 0.9\n    override:\n      roles:\n        - chat\n```\n\n## Advanced\n\n### Inputs\n\nModels and MCP server authors can configure inputs that require the user to provide a secret value by defining a `${{ inputs.SECRET_NAME }}` value.\n\nFor example, here is how you could require that the user provide a value for the `apiKey` property on a model:\n\n```yaml title=\"config.yaml\" highlight={8}\nname: myprofile/custom-model\nversion: 1.0.0\nschema: v1\n\nmodels:\n  - name: My Favorite Model\n    # ... other model properties ...\n    apiKey: ${{ inputs.SECRET_NAME }}\n```\n\nUsers then map their secret to this input using a `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` value that maps to a property name which matches the required input, e.g. `SECRET_NAME`.\n\n```yaml title=\"config.yaml\" highlight={8}\nname: myprofile/custom-config\nversion: 1.0.0\nschema: v1\n\nmodels:\n  - uses: myprofile/custom-model\n    with:\n      SECRET_NAME: ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you understand how models, rules, and tools work, explore:\n\n- **[Config Reference](/reference)**: Detailed documentation of all available properties\n- **[Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev)**: Browse community models, rules, and tools\n- **[Custom Context Providers](/customize/deep-dives/custom-providers)**: Create advanced context integrations\n- **[Model Roles](/customize/model-roles/intro)**: Understanding how different models work together\n"}

Place markdown files in `.continue/rules` in your project to provide context:\n\n```markdown\n# Project Architecture\n\nThis is a React application with:\n\n- Components in `/src/components`\n- API routes in `/src/api`\n- State management using Redux in `/src/store`\n\n## Coding Standards\n\n- Use TypeScript for all new files\n- Follow the existing naming conventions\n- Write tests for all new features\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  Place rules files at different levels of your project hierarchy to scope when\n  they trigger\n</Tip>\n\nLearn more about [rules configuration](/customize/deep-dives/rules).\n\n## Make agent mode aware of other codebases\n\nSometimes you need agent mode to understand code beyond your current project.\n\n### Public codebases\n\nFor open-source projects and public repositories, you have several options:\n\n#### Rules with hyperlinks\n\nCreate rules that point to external codebases:\n\n```markdown\n# External Dependencies\n\nOur authentication system is based on:\n\n- [Auth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev/)\n- [Example implementation](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example)\n\nWhen implementing auth features, reference these patterns.\n```\n\n#### GitHub and GitLab CLIs\n\nEnable `gh` or `glab` CLI access for agent mode to interact with repositories.\n\nAdd rules to guide CLI usage:\n\n```markdown\n# Repository Access\n\nYou can use the `gh` CLI to:\n\n- Search for issues: `gh issue list --repo owner/repo`\n- View pull requests: `gh pr list --repo owner/repo`\n- Clone repositories: `gh repo clone owner/repo`\n```\n\n#### DeepWiki MCP\n\n[DeepWiki MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/deepwiki/deepwiki-mcp) lets agent mode explore any public GitHub repository.\n\nOnce configured, agent mode can explore repositories like:\n\n- \"Explore the React repository structure\"\n- \"Find how authentication is implemented in NextAuth.js\"\n\n### Internal codebases\n\nFor private and internal repositories, you need additional setup:\n\n#### Custom MCP servers\n\nCreate an MCP server that has access to your internal repositories.\n\n#### Custom code RAG\n\nFor faster retrieval and lower costs with very large internal codebases, consider implementing a [custom code RAG](/guides/custom-code-rag) system. This is an advanced approach that requires more setup but can provide performance benefits at scale.\n\n## Make agent mode aware of relevant documentation\n\nDocumentation provides crucial context for agent mode to understand APIs, frameworks, and best practices.\n\n### Public documentation\n\n#### Rules with documentation links\n\nGuide agent mode to relevant documentation:\n\n```markdown\n# Documentation Resources\n\nFor framework-specific questions, refer to:\n\n- React: https://react.dev/reference/react\n- Next.js: https://nextjs.org/docs\n- Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs\n\nAlways cite documentation when explaining concepts.\n```\n\n#### Context7 MCP\n\n[Context7 MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/upstash/context7-mcp) enables agent mode to search and retrieve information from public documentation:\n\nAgent mode can then answer questions like:\n\n- \"How do I use React hooks?\"\n- \"What's the syntax for Tailwind CSS animations?\"\n\n### Internal documentation\n\nFor private documentation and wikis:\n\n#### Rules with internal links\n\nCreate rules that reference internal resources:\n\n```markdown\n# Internal Documentation\n\nOur team documentation is available at:\n\n- API Documentation: https://internal.docs/api\n- Architecture Guide: https://internal.docs/architecture\n- Deployment Process: https://internal.docs/deployment\n\nAlways follow our internal standards when suggesting code.\n```\n\n#### Custom MCP servers for docs\n\nCreate an MCP server that accesses your internal documentation.\n\n## Migrating from deprecated context providers\n\nIf you were previously using the `@Codebase` or `@Docs` context providers, here's how to migrate to the new approach:\n\n### Migrating from @Codebase\n\nThe `@Codebase` context provider has been deprecated. Instead:\n\n1. **Use built-in tools**: Agent mode can now use file exploration and search tools to understand your codebase\n2. **Add rules**: Create `.continue/rules` files to provide context about your project structure\n3. **Use MCP servers**: For external codebases, use DeepWiki MCP or custom MCP servers\n\n### Migrating from @Docs\n\nThe `@Docs` context provider has been deprecated. Instead:\n\n1. **Use Context7 MCP**: For public documentation, Context7 MCP provides similar functionality\n2. **Add documentation links in rules**: Create rules that reference documentation URLs\n3. **Use custom MCP servers**: For internal documentation, create an MCP server with access to your docs\n\nThe new approach provides better integration with Continue's Agent mode features and more intelligent context selection.\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Learn more about [MCP servers](/reference/continue-mcp)\n- Explore [rules configuration](/customize/deep-dives/rules)\n  - Set up [other custom configurations](/guides/understanding-configs) with specific knowledge domains\n"}

For example, you could pipe your git diff into `cn` to generate a commit message, and write this to a file:\n\n```bash\necho \"$(git diff) Generate a conventional commit name for the current git changes\" | cn -p > commit-message.txt\n```\n\n## How to Configure Continue CLI\n\n`cn` uses [`config.yaml`](/reference), the exact same configuration file as Continue. This means that you can log in to [Continue Mission Control](/hub/introduction) or use your existing local configuration.\n\nTo switch between configurations, you can use the `/config` slash command in `cn`, or you can start it with the `--config` flag (e.g. `cn --config continuedev/default-cli-config` or `cn --config ~/.continue/config.yaml`).\n\n### How to Add Custom Models\n\nLearn how to add custom models [here](/customize/overview). Then, you can use the `/model` slash command to switch between them in `cn`.\n\n### How to Configure Rules\n\n`cn` supports [rules](/customize/deep-dives/rules) in the same way as the Continue IDE extensions. You can also use the `--rule` flag to manually include a rule from Mission Control. For example, `cn --rule nate/spanish` will tell `cn` to use [this rule](https://hub.continue.dev/nate/spanish) to always speak in Spanish.\n\n### How to Configure Tools\n\n`cn` supports MCP tools, which can be configured in the [same way](/customize/deep-dives/mcp) as with the Continue IDE extensions.\n\n#### How to Set Tool Permissions\n\n`cn` includes a tool permission system to make sure you approve of the agent's actions. It will begin with minimal permissions but as you approve tool calls, it will add policies to `~/.continue/permissions.yaml` to remember your preferences.\n\nIf you want to explicitly allow or deny tools for a single session, you can use the command line flags `--allow`, `--ask`, and `--exclude`. For example:\n\n```bash\n# Always allow the Write tool\ncn --allow Write()\n\n# Always ask before running curl\ncn --ask Bash(curl*)\n\n# Never use the Fetch tool\ncn --exclude Fetch\n```\n\n## API Key Authentication\n\nFor automation in CI or other headless environments, you can use an API key to authenticate with Continue. First, obtain your personal API key [here](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys). Then, set it as the `CONTINUE_API_KEY` environment variable. You can now use `cn -p` (headless mode) without needing to log in.\n\nIf you wish to run an automation on behalf of your organization you can obtain an organization-scoped API key by going to [your organization's settings](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/organizations) -> API Keys.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nRun `cn` with the `--verbose` flag to see more detailed logs. These will be output to `~/.continue/logs/cn.log`.\n\nIf you have feedback on the beta, please [share in our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/EfJEfdFnDQ) or [leave feedback in the GitHub discussion](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/discussions/7307).\n"}

Some prefer the convenience of cloud-managed configurations, while others need the control and privacy of local setups. Continue offers both paths, and this guide will help you choose the right one for your workflow.\n\n## What Are the Two Paths to AI Assistance?\n\nContinue provides two distinct ways to configure:\n\nThink of Continue's configuration options like choosing between a managed service and self-hosting. Both get you to the same destination—powerful AI assistance in your IDE—but the journey and control level differ significantly.\n\n### How to Access Your Configuration\n\nBefore we dive into the specifics, let's understand how to access your configuration:\n\n1. Open the Continue Chat sidebar by pressing <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> (VS Code) or <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (JetBrains)\n2. Click the Config selector above the main chat input\n3. Hover over a config and click:\n   - `new window` icon for Hub configs\n   - `gear` icon for Local configs\n\n![configure](/images/configure-continue.png)\n\n## What Are Hub Configurations: The Managed Experience\n\nHub Configurations represent the \"it just works\" philosophy. When you [sign in to Continue Mission Control](https://auth.continue.dev/), you gain access to a curated ecosystem of established configurations that sync seamlessly across all your development environments.\n\n### Why Should You Choose Hub Configs?\n\n**The Power of Simplicity**\n\n- **Instant Setup**: Browse the [configuration marketplace](https://hub.continue.dev) and add any config to your account with a single click\n- **Web-Based Management**: Configure models, add secrets, and customize settings through an intuitive web interface—no JSON editing required\n- **Automatic Synchronization**: Make a change on Mission Control, and it reflects immediately across all your IDE instances\n- **Team Collaboration**: Share custom configurations with your team, ensuring everyone uses the same optimized configurations\n\n![nextjs config](/images/nextjs-assistant.png)\n\n### How to Get Started with Hub Configs\n\nThe journey from zero to AI-powered coding takes just four steps:\n\n1. **Select Your Config**: Click the config selector in your IDE's Continue panel\n2. **Explore or Create**: Browse community configurations or craft your own specialized setup\n3. **Secure Your Keys**: Add API keys as [User Secrets](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/secrets) in Mission Control—they're encrypted and never exposed\n4. **Sync and Code**: Click \"Reload config\" to pull your latest settings\n\nPro tip: Hub configurations are perfect for teams. Create a custom config with your team's coding standards, preferred models, and context sources, then share it with a simple link.\n\n### How to Manage Hub Configs\n\nAll Hub config management happens through [Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev). For detailed customization, see our guide on [Editing a Config](/hub/configs/edit-a-config).\n\n## What Are Local Configs: The Power User's Choice\n\nLocal configuration puts you in the driver's seat. Using a `config.yaml` file, you have complete control over every aspect of your Continue experience with all configuration stored directly on your machine.\n\n### Why Should You Choose Local Configs?\n\n**Complete Control and Privacy**\n\n- **Your Data, Your Rules**: All configuration stays on your machine—perfect for air-gapped environments or strict data policies\n- **Version Control Integration**: Check your `config.yaml` into git alongside your code, ensuring reproducible environments\n- **Offline Capability**: Once configured, no internet connection needed (assuming you're using local models)\n- **Unlimited Customization**: Access every configuration option, experimental feature, and advanced setting\n\n### How to Set Up Local Configs\n\nLocal configuration lives in a single YAML file in your home directory:\n\n**File Locations:**\n\n- macOS/Linux: `~/.continue/config.yaml`\n- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\\.continue\\config.yaml`\n\n**Quick Access Method:**\n\n1. Open the configs dropdown in your IDE\n2. Click the gear icon next to \"Local Config\"\n3. The `config.yaml` file opens in your editor\n\n![local-config-open-steps](/images/local-config-open-steps.png)\n\n### The Local Config Experience\n\nWhen you edit your `config.yaml`, Continue provides intelligent autocomplete for all available options. Save the file, and Continue automatically reloads your configuration—no restart required.\n\nThe first time you use Continue, it generates a `config.yaml` with sensible defaults. From there, you can customize everything from model selection to context providers, slash commands, and more.\n\nFor the complete configuration reference, see our [config.yaml documentation](/reference).\n\n## How to Make the Right Choice\n\nThe decision between Hub and Local configs often comes down to your specific needs and constraints. Here's a framework to help you decide:\n\n### Choose Hub Configs When You:\n\n**Value Convenience Over Control**\n\n- Want to start coding with AI assistance in under 60 seconds\n- Prefer visual interfaces over editing configuration files\n- Need to switch between multiple machines frequently\n- Work in a team that needs standardized AI assistance\n\n**Need Advanced Collaboration**\n\n- Want to share custom configs with teammates\n- Need centralized API key management\n- Require quick updates across your entire organization\n\n**Are Getting Started**\n\n- New to AI-powered development\n- Want to experiment with different models and configurations\n- Prefer guided setup experiences\n\n### Choose Local Configs When You:\n\n**Require Maximum Control**\n\n- Need to version control your exact configuration\n- Want to customize every aspect of the AI behavior\n- Require reproducible development environments\n\n**Have Privacy Requirements**\n\n- Work with sensitive code that requires air-gapped environments\n- Need to ensure all configuration data stays local\n- Have strict compliance requirements about data storage\n\n**Are a Power User**\n\n- Comfortable editing YAML/JSON files\n- Want access to experimental features\n- Need to integrate with local tools and scripts\n\n## How to Use the Hybrid Approach\n\nHere's a secret: you don't have to choose just one. Many developers use both approaches:\n\n- **Hub Configs** for general development and experimentation\n- **Local Configs** for production work or client projects with specific requirements\n\nYou can switch between them seamlessly using the configs selector in your IDE.\n\n## Common Patterns and Best Practices\n\n### For Hub Config Users\n\n1. **Start with Community Configs**: Before creating your own, explore what others have built\n2. **Use Secrets Properly**: Never hardcode API keys—always use the User Secrets feature\n3. **Create Specialized Configs**: Make different configs for different contexts (frontend, backend, DevOps)\n4. **Share Liberally**: If you create something useful, share it with the community\n\n### For Local Config Users\n\n1. **Version Control Your Config**: Treat your `config.yaml` like code—commit it, review changes, and maintain history\n2. **Use Environment Variables**: For sensitive data, reference environment variables instead of hardcoding values\n3. **Document Your Setup**: Add comments to your config explaining non-obvious choices\n4. **Keep a Backup**: Before major changes, save a working copy of your configuration\n\n## Troubleshooting and Tips\n\n### Hub Config Issues\n\n**Changes Not Reflecting?**\n\n- Click \"Reload config\" in your IDE\n- Check your internet connection\n- Ensure you're signed in to the correct account\n\n**Config Not Available?**\n\n- Verify it's added to your account on Mission Control\n- Check if it requires specific API keys\n\n### Local Config Issues\n\n**Config Not Loading?**\n\n- Verify file location matches your OS\n- Check YAML syntax (Continue will show errors)\n- Ensure file permissions allow reading\n\n**Autocomplete Not Working?**\n\n- Update to the latest Continue version\n- Check that you're editing the correct file\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you understand both configuration approaches, you're ready to dive deeper:\n\n  - **For Hub Users**: [Create A Config](/hub/configs/create-a-config)\n- **For Local Users**: [Explore the Config Reference](/reference)\n- **For Everyone**: [Discover Available Models](/customize/model-providers/overview)\n\nRemember, the best configuration is the one that helps you code more effectively. Start simple, experiment freely, and gradually refine your setup as you discover what works best for your workflow.\n\nHappy coding with Continue! 🚀\n"}

As outlined in our [Continuous AI guide](/guides/continuous-ai#best-practices-for-sustainable-continuous-ai), this reduces intervention rates and accelerates secure development.\n  \n  **Get Started:** Use this cookbook to understand the fundamentals, then [enable Mission Control](/mission-control/integrations/snyk) to deploy autonomous security agents across your organization.\n\n</Note>\n\n<Card title=\"What You'll Build\" icon=\"shield-halved\">\n  An automated security scanning system that uses Continue's AI agent with Snyk\n  MCP to identify vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, infrastructure, and\n  containers - all through simple natural language prompts\n</Card>\n\n## Demo Video\n\n<iframe\n  width=\"100%\"\n  height=\"400\"\n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwVnKOf3tVg\"\n  title=\"Snyk MCP Continue Cookbook Demo\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n  allowfullscreen\n></iframe>\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting, ensure you have:\n\n- Continue account with **Hub access**\n- Read: [Understanding Configs — How to get started with Hub configs](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs)\n- Node.js 18+ installed locally\n- [Snyk account](https://snyk.io/) (free tier works)\n- A local project to scan for vulnerabilities\n\nFor all options, first:\n<Steps>\n<Step title=\"Install Continue CLI\">\n    ```bash\n    npm i -g @continuedev/cli\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Add Your Project to Snyk\">\n\n  1. Sign up for a Snyk account at [snyk.io](https://snyk.io/)\n  2. Create a new project in Snyk by importing your code repository (Git \n  provider or manual upload)\n  3. Install and authenticate the Snyk CLI locally:\n     ```bash\n     npm install -g snyk\n     snyk auth\n     ```\n     This will open your browser to authenticate with your Snyk account.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Note>\n  **Important**: The Snyk MCP requires the Snyk CLI to be authenticated locally. Run `snyk auth` to authenticate before using the Continue agent with Snyk MCP.\n</Note>\n <Warning>\n  To use agents in headless mode, you need a [Continue API key](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys).\n  </Warning>\n\n## Snyk Continuous AI Workflow Options\n\n<Card title=\"🚀 Fastest Path to Success\" icon=\"zap\">\n  Skip the manual setup and use our pre-built Snyk Continuous AI agent that includes\n  the Snyk MCP and optimized security scanning workflows for more consistent results.\n</Card>\n\n\nAfter ensuring you meet the **Prerequisites** above, you have two paths to get started:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)\">\n    <Steps>\n      <Step title=\"Load the Pre-Built Agent\">\n        Navigate to your project directory and run:\n        ```bash\n        cn --agent continuedev/snyk-continuous-ai-agent\n        ```\n\n        This agent includes:\n        - **Snyk MCP** pre-configured and ready to use\n        - **Security-focused rules** for best practices\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Run Your First Security Scan\">\n        From your project directory, start with a comprehensive security scan:\n        ```bash\n         # Headless mode\n        cn -p \"Run a complete security scan on this project including code vulnerabilities, dependencies, and any IaC files. Summarize findings by severity.\" --auto\n        ```\n\n        That's it! The agent handles everything automatically.\n      </Step>\n    </Steps>\n\n    <Info>\n      **Why Use the Agent?** The pre-built agent provides consistent security scanning workflows and handles MCP configuration automatically, making it easier to get started with AI-powered security scanning.\n    </Info>\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"🛠️ Manual Setup\">\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create a New Agent via the Continue Mission Control\">\n    Go to the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) and [create a new agent](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=agent).\n    </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Connect Snyk MCP via Continue Mission Control\">\n    Visit the [Snyk Continuous AI Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/snyk-continuous-ai-agent) and click **Install** to add it to the agent you created in the step above.\n\n    This will add Snyk MCP to your agent's available tools. The Mission Control listing automatically configures the MCP command:\n    ```bash\n    npx -y snyk@latest mcp -t stdio\n    ```\n\n    <Tip>\n      **Alternative installation methods:**\n      1. **Quick CLI install**: `cn --mcp snyk/snyk-mcp`\n      2. **Manual configuration**: Add the MCP to your `~/.continue/config.json` under the `mcpServers` section\n\n      Once installed, Snyk MCP tools become available to your Continue agent for all prompts.\n    </Tip>\n\n    <Info>\n      The MCP will request authentication and folder trust permissions when first used.\n      This is handled automatically by the Continue agent.\n    </Info>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Add Secure-at-Inception Rules\">\n    Install the [Snyk Secure-at-Inception rules](https://hub.continue.dev/snyk/secure-at-inception) from Mission Control to enable automatic security scanning.\n\n    **How to add rules to your agent:**\n    1. Visit the rules link above and click **Install**\n    2. The rules will be added to your agent configuration automatically\n    3. Rules apply globally to all your Continue sessions\n\n    These rules configure your agent to:\n    - **Run [SAST](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/sast/) scans** on newly generated or modified code\n    - **Check dependencies** when adding or updating packages\n    - **Auto-fix issues** using Snyk's recommendations, then rescan\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Run Your First Security Scan\">\n    Start with a comprehensive security scan:\n    ```bash\n    # TUI mode\n    cn \"Run a complete security scan on this project including code vulnerabilities, dependencies, and any IaC files. Summarize findings by severity.\"\n    ```\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Agent Requirements\">\n    To use the pre-built agent, you need either: \n      - **Continue CLI Pro Plan** with the models add-on, OR \n      - **Your own API keys** added to Continue Mission Control secrets (same as manual setup)\n      \n    The agent will automatically detect and use your configuration along with the pre-configured Snyk MCP for security scanning operations.\n\n</Accordion>\n\n---\n\n## Security Scanning Recipes\n\nNow you can use natural language prompts to run comprehensive security scans. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate Snyk MCP tools.\n\n<Info>\nYou can add prompts to your agent's configuration for easy access in future sessions. Go to your agent in the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev), click **Edit**, and add prompts under the **Prompts** section.\n</Info>\n\n<Info>\n  **Where to run these workflows:**\n  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs\n  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts\n  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p \"your prompt\" --auto` for headless commands\n\n  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running security scans that might make\n  changes, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode\n  Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes in TUI/IDE). This\n  shows you what the agent will do without executing it. For example: `\"Run a\n  Snyk Code scan and fix the top 3 issues\"`\n</Info>\n\n### Code Vulnerability Scanning ([SAST](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/sast/))\n\n<Card title=\"Static Application Security Testing\" icon=\"code\">\n  Scan your source code for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nRun a Snyk Code scan on this repo with severity threshold medium.\nSummarize issues with file:line.

You can [remix this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) to customize it for your specific needs.\n</Card>\n\n\nAfter ensuring you meet the **Prerequisites** above, you have two paths to get started:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)\">\n    <Steps>\n      <Step title=\"Load the Pre-Built Agent\">\n        Navigate to your pipeline project directory and run:\n        ```bash\n        cn --agent continuedev/dlt-agent\n        ```\n\n        This agent includes:\n        - **dlt MCP** pre-configured and ready to use\n        - **Pipeline-focused rules** for data engineering best practices\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Run Your First Pipeline Inspection\">\n        Start with a comprehensive pipeline check:\n        ```bash\n        # TUI mode\n        Inspect the execution of my dlt pipeline and summarize the load info, including timing and file sizes.\n        ```\n\n        That's it! The agent handles everything automatically.\n      </Step>\n    </Steps>\n\n    <Info>\n      **Why Use the Agent?** The pre-built [dlt Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/dlt-agent) provides consistent pipeline development workflows and handles MCP configuration automatically, making it easier to get started with AI-powered data engineering. You can [remix and customize this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) later to fit your team's specific workflow.\n    </Info>\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"🛠️ Manual Setup\">\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create a New Agent via the Continue Mission Control\">\n    Go to the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) and [create a new agent](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=agent).\n    </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Connect dlt MCP via Continue Mission Control\">\n    Visit the [dlt MCP on Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-mcp) and click **Install** to add it to the agent you created in the step above.\n\n    This will add dlt MCP to your agent's available tools. The Mission Control listing automatically configures the MCP command.\n\n    <Tip>\n      **Alternative installation methods:**\n      1. **Quick CLI install**: `cn --mcp dlthub/dlt-mcp`\n      2. **Manual configuration**: Add the MCP to your `~/.continue/config.json` under the `mcpServers` section\n\n      Once installed, dlt MCP tools become available to your Continue agent for all prompts.\n    </Tip>\n\n    <Info>\n      The MCP will work with your existing dlt pipelines in your current directory.\n    </Info>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Run Your First Pipeline Inspection\">\n    Start with a comprehensive pipeline check:\n    ```bash\n    # TUI mode\n    cn\n    # Then type: Inspect the execution of my dlt pipeline and summarize the load info, including timing and file sizes.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Agent Requirements\">\n    To use the pre-built [dlt Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/dlt-agent), you need either:\n      - **Continue CLI Pro Plan** with the models add-on, OR\n      - **Your own API keys** added to Continue Mission Control secrets (same as manual setup)\n\n    The agent will automatically detect and use your configuration along with the pre-configured dlt MCP for pipeline operations.\n\n</Accordion>\n\n---\n\n## dlt MCP vs dlt+ MCP\n\n<Card title=\"Understanding the Difference\" icon=\"info-circle\">\n  **dlt MCP** is focused on local pipeline development and inspection. It provides tools to:\n  - Inspect pipeline execution and load information\n  - Retrieve schema metadata from your local pipelines\n  - Query dataset records from destination databases\n  - Analyze load errors, timings, and file sizes\n\n  **[dlt+ MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-plus-mcp)** extends these capabilities with cloud-based features for production deployments:\n  - Connect to dlt+ Projects and manage deployments\n  - Monitor pipeline runs across multiple environments\n  - Access centralized logging and observability\n  - Collaborate with team members on pipeline development\n\n  For local development and getting started, **[dlt MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-mcp)** is the right choice. Consider **[dlt+ MCP](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-plus-mcp)** when you need production deployment features and team collaboration.\n</Card>\n\n---\n\n## Pipeline Development Recipes\n\nNow you can use natural language prompts to develop and debug your dlt pipelines. The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate dlt MCP tools.\n\n<Info>\nYou can add prompts to your agent's configuration for easy access in future sessions. Go to your agent in the [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev), click **Edit**, and add prompts under the **Prompts** section.\n</Info>\n\n<Info>\n  **Where to run these workflows:**\n  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs\n  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts\n  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p \"your prompt\"` for headless commands\n\n  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running pipeline operations that might make\n  changes, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode\n  Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes in TUI/IDE). This\n  shows you what the agent will do without executing it.\n  \n  To run any of the example prompts below in headless mode, use `cn -p \"prompt\"`\n</Info>\n\n<Info>\n\n  **About the --auto flag**: The `--auto` flag enables tools to run continuously without manual confirmation. This is essential for headless mode where the agent needs to execute multiple tools automatically to complete tasks like pipeline inspection, schema retrieval, and error analysis.\n\n</Info>\n\n### Pipeline Inspection\n\n<Card title=\"Inspect Pipeline Execution\" icon=\"magnifying-glass\">\n  Review pipeline execution details including load timing and file sizes.\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nInspect my dlt pipeline execution and provide a summary of the load info.\nShow me the timing breakdown and file sizes for each table.\n```\n\n</Card>\n\n### Schema Management\n\n<Card title=\"Retrieve Schema Metadata\" icon=\"diagram-project\">\n  Get detailed schema information for your pipeline's tables.\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nShow me the schema for my users table including all columns,\ndata types, and any constraints.\n```\n\n</Card>\n\n### Data Exploration\n\n<Card title=\"Query Dataset Records\" icon=\"table\">\n  Retrieve and analyze records from your destination database.\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nGet the last 10 records from my orders table and show me\nthe distribution of order statuses.\n```\n\n</Card>\n\n### Error Debugging\n\n<Card title=\"Analyze Load Errors\" icon=\"triangle-exclamation\">\n  Investigate and understand pipeline load errors.\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nCheck for any load errors in my last pipeline run. If there are errors,\nexplain what went wrong and suggest fixes.\n```\n\n</Card>\n\n### Pipeline Creation\n\n<Card title=\"Build New Pipeline\" icon=\"plus\">\n  Create a new dlt pipeline from an API or data source.\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nHelp me create a new dlt pipeline that loads data from the\nJSONPlaceholder API users endpoint into DuckDB.\n```\n\n</Card>\n\n### Schema Evolution\n\n<Card title=\"Handle Schema Changes\" icon=\"code-branch\">\n  Review and manage schema evolution in your pipelines.\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nCheck if my pipeline schema has evolved since the last run.\nShow me what columns were added or modified.\n```\n\n</Card>\n\n## Continuous Data Pipelines with GitHub Actions\n\n  This example demonstrates a **Continuous AI workflow** where data pipeline validation runs automatically in your CI/CD pipeline in headless mode using the [dlt Assistant agent](https://hub.continue.dev/dlthub/dlt-assistant). Consider [remixing this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) to add your organization's specific validation rules.\n\n### Add GitHub Secrets\n\nNavigate to **Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:\n\n- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)\n- Any required database credentials for your destination\n\n<Info>\n      The workflow uses the pre-built [dlt Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/dlt-agent) with `--agent continuedev/dlt-agent`. This agent comes pre-configured with the dlt MCP and optimized rules for pipeline operations. You can [remix this agent](/guides/understanding-configs#how-to-get-started-with-hub-configs) to customize the validation rules and prompts for your specific pipeline requirements.\n</Info>\n\n### Create Workflow File\n\nThis workflow automatically validates your dlt data pipelines on pull requests using the Continue CLI in [headless mode](/cli/overview#headless-mode%3A-production-automation). It inspects pipeline schemas, checks for errors, and posts a summary report as a PR comment. The workflow can also be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`.\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/dlt-pipeline-validation.yml` in your repository:\n\n```yaml\nname: Data Pipeline Validation with dlt MCP\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\njobs:\n  validate-pipeline:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    env:\n      CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}\n\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n        with:\n          python-version: \"3.11\"\n\n      - name: Set up Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: \"18\"\n\n      - name: Install dlt\n        run: |\n          pip install dlt\n          echo \"✅ dlt installed\"\n\n      - name: Install Continue CLI\n        run: |\n          npm install -g @continuedev/cli\n          echo \"✅ Continue CLI installed\"\n\n      - name: Validate Pipeline Schema\n        run: |\n          echo \"🔍 Validating pipeline schema...\"\n          cn --agent continuedev/dlt-agent \\\n             -p \"Inspect the pipeline schema and verify all required tables\n                 and columns are present.

This\n  shows you what the agent will do without executing it. For example: `\"Set up\n  A/B testing between main and feature branch with performance monitoring\"`\n</Tip>\n\n<Info>\n\n    Netlify automatically tracks: \n    - **Build Performance**: Compile times, cache\n    hits \n    - **Runtime Performance**: Core Web Vitals, Time to Interactive \n    -  **Resource Usage**: Bandwidth, function execution times\n    \n</Info>\n\n### Step 2: A/B Test Branch Performance\n\nCompare performance between branches:\n\n```bash\n# In cn TUI mode:\n\"Set up A/B test between main and feature branch on Netlify:\n- Split traffic 50/50 between branches\n- Track Core Web Vitals for each variant\n- Monitor conversion metrics and bounce rate\n- Enable analytics to measure performance impact\n- Configure cookie-based visitor persistence\n- Set test duration for 1000 unique visitors\n- Auto-conclude test when statistical significance reached\nReport winner based on performance + conversion metrics\"\n```\n\n<Info>\n  **Enhanced Analytics**: Combine Netlify's A/B testing with PostHog session\n  recordings to understand not just which variant performs better, but why users\n  behave differently. See our [PostHog session analysis\n  guide](/guides/posthog-github-continuous-ai) to set up session tracking and\n  create a complete continuous AI analytics workflow.\n</Info>\n\n### Step 3: Advanced Build Optimization with Netlify\n\nLeverage Netlify's powerful build features to dramatically reduce build times:\n\n```bash\n# In cn TUI mode:\n\"Optimize my Netlify build performance using these features:\n\n1. Enable Netlify Cache Plugin for dependency caching\n   - Configure @netlify/plugin-cache for node_modules\n   - Set up custom cache directories for .next/cache or .nuxt\n   - Enable Gatsby's incremental builds if applicable\n\n2. Set up Build Plugins from Netlify's ecosystem:\n   - Install @netlify/plugin-lighthouse for performance monitoring\n   - Add netlify-plugin-checklinks to prevent broken links\n   - Configure netlify-plugin-submit-sitemap for SEO\n\n3. Implement Conditional Builds:\n   - Skip builds when only docs change (ignore: /docs/**)\n   - Use build.ignore script for custom logic\n   - Set up monorepo-specific build triggers\n\n4. Configure concurrent builds for monorepos\n   - Set base directory per package\n   - Use pnpm workspaces or yarn workspaces\n\nShow me the netlify.toml configuration and explain each optimization\"\n```\n\n<Info>\n  **Netlify Build Features You're Getting**:\n  - [Build Caching](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-caching/) - Persist dependencies between builds\n  - [Build Plugins](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/build-plugins/) - Extend build process with 100+ plugins\n  - [Conditional Builds](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/ignore-builds/) - Skip unnecessary builds\n  - [Monorepo Support](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/monorepos/) - Optimize multi-package repos\n\nThese features can reduce build times by 50-70% for most projects!\n\n</Info>\n\n<Tip>\n  **Discover more optimization prompts!** The Netlify community has documented dozens of build optimization strategies in their [Support Guide: How can I optimize my Netlify build time](https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-how-can-i-optimize-my-netlify-build-time/3907). \n  \n  Use this guide as inspiration for cn CLI prompts not covered in this cookbook, such as:\n  - `\"Configure my builds to skip Dependabot PRs automatically\"`\n  - `\"Set up custom ignore patterns for documentation-only changes\"`\n  - `\"Optimize my Contentful webhooks to prevent duplicate builds\"`\n  - `\"Show me how to use build hooks instead of automatic git triggers\"`\n  - `\"Help me choose between Astro and Hugo based on build performance\"`\n  \n  The community guide contains real-world scenarios that you can turn into AI-assisted solutions - just describe what you want to achieve and let cn CLI handle the implementation!\n</Tip>\n\n### Step 4: Bundle Analysis with Netlify's Built-in Tools\n\nUse Netlify's bundle analyzer and optimization features:\n\n```bash\n# In cn TUI mode:\n\"Analyze and optimize my bundle using Netlify's tools:\n\n1.

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"docs/guides/sentry-mcp-error-monitoring.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Automated Error Analysis with Sentry MCP\"\ndescription: \"Build an AI-powered error monitoring workflow that analyzes Sentry issues, identifies patterns, and creates actionable GitHub issues automatically.\"\nsidebarTitle: \"Sentry Automated Error Analysis with MCP\"\n---\n\n<Note>\n\n  **🚀 New: Sentry Mission Control Integration with Continuous AI**\n  \n  The new [Sentry Mission Control Integration](/mission-control/integrations/sentry) enables **[Continuous AI](/guides/continuous-ai)** for error monitoring - where AI agents autonomously detect, analyze, and fix production errors. When Sentry detects an issue, your agent automatically analyzes it, generates a fix, creates a PR, and validates the solution without manual intervention.\n  \n  **Mission Control Benefits:**\n  - **Webhook-based triggers** - Automatically respond when new errors occur in production\n  - **Centralized error workflows** - Manage all error monitoring Tasks from one dashboard\n  - **Dedicated inbox view** - Monitor all Sentry-related agent activity at [hub.continue.dev/inbox?view=sentry](https://hub.continue.dev/inbox?view=sentry)\n  - **Metrics & intervention rates** - Track how often agents successfully fix errors without human help\n  \n  This represents **[Level 2 Continuous AI](/guides/continuous-ai#the-continuous-ai-maturity-model)**: AI handles routine error analysis and fixes autonomously while developers focus on complex problems. As outlined in our [Continuous AI guide](/guides/continuous-ai#best-practices-for-sustainable-continuous-ai), this reduces mean time to resolution (MTTR) and improves application reliability.\n  \n  **Get Started:** Use this cookbook to understand error monitoring fundamentals, then [enable Mission Control](/mission-control/integrations/sentry) to deploy autonomous error-fixing agents across your organization.\n\n</Note>\n\n<Card title=\"What You'll Build\" icon=\"bug\">\n  An automated error monitoring system that uses Continue CLI with Sentry MCP to analyze production errors, identify root causes with AI, and create detailed GitHub issues with suggested fixes.\n</Card>\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\nThis cookbook teaches you to:\n\n- Use [Sentry MCP](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/) to access [issues](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/)\n- Analyze error patterns and stack traces with AI\n\n- Automatically create GitHub issues with root cause analysis\n- Set up continuous error monitoring with GitHub Actions\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting, ensure you have:\n\n- GitHub repository where you want to create issues\n- [Sentry account](https://sentry.io) with an active project collecting errors\n- Node.js 18+ installed locally\n- [Continue CLI](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/cli) with **active credits** (required for API usage)\n- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed (`gh` command)\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Install Continue CLI\">\n    ```bash\n    npm i -g @continuedev/cli\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Set up Continue CLI Account & API Key\">\n    1. Visit [Continue Organizations](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/organizations)\n    2. Sign up or log in to your Continue account\n    3. Navigate to your organization settings\n    4. Click **\"API Keys\"** and then **\"+ New API Key\"**\n    5. Copy the API key immediately (you won't see it again!)\n    6. Login to the CLI: `cn login`\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Tip>\n  Continue CLI handles complex error analysis and API interactions - you just need to provide the right prompts!\n</Tip>\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Your Credentials\n\nFirst, you'll need to gather your Sentry and GitHub API credentials.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Configure Sentry MCP\">\n\n    <Tip>\n      See [Sentry MCP Documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/) for detailed configuration options\n    </Tip>\n\n    The Sentry MCP supports multiple configuration methods. For Continue CLI, OAuth is recommended:\n\n    **Option 1: OAuth Configuration (Recommended)**\n\n    The Sentry MCP will prompt for OAuth authentication when first used. Simply follow the authorization flow.\n\n    **Option 2: STDIO Mode with Auth Token**\n\n    For local development or self-hosted Sentry installations, you can use STDIO mode:\n    ```bash\n    npx @sentry/mcp-server@latest --access-token=YOUR_SENTRY_TOKEN --host=sentry.io\n    ```\n\n    Or use environment variables:\n    ```bash\n    SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token SENTRY_HOST=sentry.io\n    ```\n\n    <Info>\n      The `--host` parameter is required and should point to your Sentry instance (e.g., `sentry.io` or `sentry.example.com` for self-hosted).\n    </Info>\n\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Sentry API Credentials\">\n    You'll need a **Sentry User Auth Token** to access issues and error data:\n\n    1. Go to [User Auth Tokens](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) in Sentry\n       - For self-hosted Sentry, use: `https://YOUR-SENTRY-DOMAIN/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/`\n    2. Click **Create New Token**\n    3. Name it \"Continue CLI Error Analysis\"\n    4. **Select these permission scopes** (required for full functionality):\n       - `org:read` - **Required** - Access organization information\n       - `project:read` - **Required** - Read project configurations\n       - `project:releases` - **Required** - Access release information for deployment tracking\n       - `event:read` - **Required** - Read detailed error event data and stack traces\n       - `event:write` - Optional - Update error events (for marking as resolved)\n       - `member:read` - Recommended - Read team member information for auto-assignment\n       - `team:read` - Recommended - Access team data for routing issues\n    5. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)\n    6. Note your organization slug (found in your Sentry URL: `https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR-ORG-SLUG`)\n    7. Note your Sentry host URL (typically `https://sentry.io` or your self-hosted domain)\n\n    <Info>\n      **Sentry MCP Connection**: The MCP server connects via OAuth to `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp` and handles authentication securely. For local development, you can use STDIO mode with your auth token.\n    </Info>\n\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"Set Up GitHub CLI Authentication\">\n   GitHub CLI handles authentication automatically - no manual PAT needed:\n\n    1. Install GitHub CLI if not already installed\n    2. Run `gh auth login` and follow the prompts\n    3. Choose authentication method (browser or token)\n    4. Grant necessary permissions when prompted (`issues:write` is **required** for creating issues)\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n## Sentry Error Monitoring Workflow Options\n\n<Card title=\"Fastest Path to Success\" icon=\"rocket\">\n  Skip the manual setup and use our pre-built Sentry Continuous AI agent that includes\n  optimized prompts, rules, and the Sentry MCP for more consistent results.\n</Card>\n\n<Info>\n  **How Sentry MCP Works**:\n  - Connects to your Sentry organization via OAuth\n  - Provides tools for accessing issues, projects, teams, and DSNs\n  - Supports both hosted (`https://mcp.sentry.dev`) and self-hosted Sentry instances\n  - Automatically handles authentication and API interactions\n</Info>\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"⚡ Quick Start (Recommended)\">\n    **Perfect for:** Immediate error analysis with AI-powered root cause detection and built-in debugging\n\n    <Steps>\n      <Step title=\"Add the Pre-Built Agent\">\n        Visit the [Sentry Continuous AI Agent](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/sentry-continuous-ai-agent) on Continue Mission Control and click **\"Install Agent\"** or run:\n        \n        ```bash\n        cn --agent continuedev/sentry-continuous-ai-agent\n        ```\n\n        This agent includes:\n        - **Optimized prompts** for Sentry error analysis and GitHub issue creation\n        - **Built-in rules** for consistent formatting and error handling\n        - **[Sentry MCP](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/)** for more reliable API interactions\n        - **Automatic authentication** via OAuth flow\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Run Error Analysis\">\n        Navigate to your project directory and enter this prompt in the Continue CLI TUI:\n        \n        ```\n        Analyze recent Sentry errors and create GitHub issues for critical bugs with suggested fixes\n        ```\n\n        That's it! The agent handles everything automatically.\n      </Step>\n    </Steps>\n\n    <Info>\n      **Why Use the Agent?** Results are more consistent and debugging is easier thanks to the Sentry MCP integration and pre-tested prompts.\n    </Info>\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"🛠️ Manual Setup\">\n    <Steps>\n      <Step title=\"Add Sentry MCP to Continue CLI\">\n        Configure the [Sentry MCP](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/) using OAuth:\n\n        The MCP server will automatically prompt for OAuth authentication when you first use it.\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Verify Sentry Connection\">\n        Test your Sentry MCP connection with this prompt:\n        \n        ```\n        List my Sentry organizations and projects\n        ```\n      </Step>\n\n      <Step title=\"Create Custom Error Analysis Prompts\">\n        Use this prompt template with Continue CLI to analyze Sentry errors:\n\n        ```\n        Analyze Sentry errors from the past 24 hours:\n        - Group errors by root cause\n        - Identify the top 5 most critical issues by frequency and impact\n        - For each critical issue, provide:\n          * Stack trace analysis\n          * Affected user count\n          * First seen and last seen timestamps\n          * Suggested fix based on error context\n        - Create GitHub issues using gh CLI with:\n          * Title format: '🐛 [Sentry] [Error Type]: Brief description'\n          * Labels: 'bug', 'sentry', 'production'\n          * Priority labels based on severity\n          * Full error context and suggested fix in the body\n        Execute the commands and confirm each issue was created.\n        ```\n      </Step>\n    </Steps>\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Info>\n  **Why GitHub CLI over GitHub MCP**: While GitHub MCP is available, it can be\n  token-expensive to run. The `gh` CLI is more efficient, requires no API tokens\n  (authenticated via `gh auth login`), and provides a cleaner command-line\n  experience. GitHub MCP remains an option if you prefer full MCP integration.\n</Info>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Agent Requirements\">\n  To use the pre-built agent, you need either:\n  - **Continue CLI Pro Plan** with the models add-on, OR\n  - **Your own API keys** added to Continue Mission Control secrets (same as Step 1)\n  \n  The agent will automatically detect and use your configuration. For Sentry MCP:\n  - **Sentry account** with at least one project\n  - **User Auth Token** with appropriate scopes (or OAuth flow)\n  - The MCP works with both Sentry's hosted service (`sentry.io`) and self-hosted instances\n</Accordion>\n\n---\n\n<Warning>\n  **Repository Labels Required**: Make sure your GitHub repository has these labels:\n  - `bug`, `sentry`, `production`\n  - `critical`, `high-priority`, `medium-priority`, `low-priority`\n  - `needs-investigation`, `has-fix`\n\n  Create missing labels in your repo at: **Settings → Labels → New label**\n</Warning>\n\n## Step 2: Analyze Sentry Errors with AI\n\nUse Continue CLI to perform intelligent error analysis. Enter these prompts in the Continue CLI TUI:\n\n<Info>\nTo run any of the example prompts below in headless mode, use `cn -p \"prompt\"`\n</Info>\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Recent Errors Analysis\">\n    **Prompt:**\n    ```\n    Show me Sentry errors from the past 7 days, grouped by error type, with frequency counts\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Critical Error Investigation\">\n    **Prompt:**\n    ```\n    Find the most critical Sentry error affecting the most users in production and provide:\n    - Full stack trace analysis\n    - Affected user count and browser/OS breakdown\n    - Timeline of when the error started occurring\n    - Similar historical issues from Sentry\n    - Root cause hypothesis based on code context\n    - Suggested fix with code examples\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Performance Issue Detection\">\n    **Prompt:**\n    ```\n    Analyze Sentry performance data to identify:\n    - Slowest transactions in the past 24 hours\n    - Database queries with high latency\n    - API endpoints with degraded performance\n    - Suggested optimizations for each issue\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Info>\n  **Available Sentry MCP Tools**:\n  - **Organizations**: Access org-level data and settings\n  - **Projects**: Query projects and their configurations\n  - **Issues**: Search and analyze error issues\n  - **Teams**: Manage team assignments\n  - **DSNs**: Retrieve project DSN configurations\n\n</Info>\n\n## Step 3: Automate GitHub Issue Creation\n\nCreate actionable GitHub issues from Sentry errors. Enter this prompt in the Continue CLI TUI:\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nFor each unresolved Sentry error with 'critical' or 'high' severity:\n1. Analyze the error using Sentry MCP\n2. Create a GitHub issue with gh CLI:\n   - Title: '🐛 [Sentry] [Error Type]: Brief description'\n   - Body with:\n     * Error summary and impact (affected users, frequency)\n     * Full stack trace\n     * Environment details (browser, OS, release version)\n     * Link to Sentry issue\n     * Root cause analysis from AI\n     * Suggested fix with code snippets\n     * Related Sentry issues\n   - Labels: 'bug', 'sentry', 'production', and severity label\n   - Assignees: Team member based on code ownership\n3. Update Sentry issue with GitHub issue link\n4. Confirm creation with GitHub issue URL\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  **Best Practice**: Link GitHub issues back to Sentry for full traceability. This creates a bidirectional connection between your error monitoring and issue tracking.\n</Tip>\n\n## Step 4: Set Up Continuous Monitoring with GitHub Actions\n\nAutomate error monitoring with the [Sentry Release GitHub Action](https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/setup/release-automation/github-actions/) and Continue CLI to create comprehensive, AI-powered issue descriptions:\n\n<Tip>\n  **Why Combine Sentry Releases with Continue CLI?**\n  - **Release Tracking**: Associate errors with specific deployments\n  - **AI-Powered Analysis**: Continue CLI generates detailed issue descriptions with root cause analysis\n  - **Better Context**: Link errors to commits and pull requests\n  - **Automated Workflows**: Create issues with full stack traces and suggested fixes\n</Tip>\n\n```yaml\nname: Sentry Error Monitoring\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  schedule:\n    # Run every 6 hours\n    - cron: \"0 */6 * * *\"\n  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers\n\njobs:\n  monitor-errors:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: \"22\"\n\n      # Create Sentry release for better error tracking\n      - name: Create Sentry release\n        uses: getsentry/action-release@v1\n        env:\n          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n          SENTRY_ORG: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_ORG }}\n          SENTRY_PROJECT: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_PROJECT }}\n        with:\n          environment: production\n\n      - name: Install Continue CLI\n        run: |\n          npm install -g @continuedev/cli\n          echo \"✅ Continue CLI installed\"\n\n      - name: Authenticate GitHub CLI\n        run: |\n          echo \"${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\" | gh auth login --with-token\n          echo \"✅ GitHub CLI authenticated\"\n\n      - name: Analyze Sentry Errors and Create Issues\n        env:\n          CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}\n          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n          SENTRY_ORG: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_ORG }}\n          SENTRY_PROJECT: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_PROJECT }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"🔍 Analyzing Sentry errors...\"\n          \n          # Use Continue CLI to analyze errors and generate comprehensive issue descriptions\n          cn -p \"Using Sentry MCP, analyze errors from the past 6 hours for project $SENTRY_PROJECT:\n                 1.

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"docs/guides/custom-code-rag.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"How to Build Custom Code RAG\"\ndescription: \"Build a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for faster and more cost-efficient code search across large codebases. This guide is for advanced users who need to index code a single time across all users or include custom logic.\"\nkeywords: [RAG, vector database, embeddings, code search, MCP]\n---\n\n## Step 1: How to Choose an Embeddings Model\n\nIf possible, we recommend using [`voyage-code-3`](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings), which will give the most accurate answers of any existing embeddings model for code. You can obtain an API key [here](https://dash.voyageai.com/api-keys). Because their API is [OpenAI-compatible](https://docs.voyageai.com/reference/embeddings-api), you can use any OpenAI client by swapping out the URL.\n\n## Step 2: How to Choose a Vector Database\n\nThere are a number of available vector databases, but because most vector databases will be able to performantly handle large codebases, we would recommend choosing one for ease of setup and experimentation.\n\n[LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/basic/) is a good choice for this because it can run in-memory with libraries for both Python and Node.js. This means that in the beginning you can focus on writing code rather than setting up infrastructure. If you have already chosen a vector database, then using this instead of LanceDB is also a fine choice.\n\n## Step 3: How to Choose a \"Chunking\" Strategy\n\nMost embeddings models can only handle a limited amount of text at once. To get around this, we \"chunk\" our code into smaller pieces.\n\nIf you use `voyage-code-3`, it has a maximum context length of 16,000 tokens, which is enough to fit most files. This means that in the beginning you can get away with a more naive strategy of truncating files that exceed the limit. In order of easiest to most comprehensive, 3 chunking strategies you can use are:\n\n1. Truncate the file when it goes over the context length: in this case you will always have 1 chunk per file.\n2. Split the file into chunks of a fixed length: starting at the top of the file, add lines in your current chunk until it reaches the limit, then start a new chunk.\n3. Use a recursive, abstract syntax tree (AST)-based strategy: this is the most exact, but most complex. In most cases you can achieve high quality results by using (1) or (2), but if you'd like to try this you can find a reference example in [our code chunker](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/indexing/chunk/code.ts) or in [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/node_parsers/code/).\n\nAs usual in this guide, we recommend starting with the strategy that gives 80% of the benefit with 20% of the effort.\n\n## Step 4: How to Put Together an Indexing Script\n\nIndexing, in which we will insert your code into the vector database in a retrievable format, happens in three steps:\n\n1. Chunking\n2. Generating embeddings\n3. Inserting into the vector database\n\nWith LanceDB, we can do steps 2 and 3 simultaneously, as demonstrated [in their docs](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/basic/#using-the-embedding-api). If you are using Voyage AI for example, it would be configured like this:\n\n```\nfrom lancedb.pydantic import LanceModel, Vectorfrom lancedb.embeddings import get_registrydb = lancedb.connect(\"/tmp/db\")func = get_registry().get(\"openai\").create(    name=\"voyage-code-3\",    base_url=\"https://api.voyageai.com/v1/\",    api_key=os.environ[\"VOYAGE_API_KEY\"],)class CodeChunks(LanceModel):    filename: str    text: str = func.SourceField()    # 1024 is the default dimension for `voyage-code-3`: https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings#model-choices    vector: Vector(1024) = func.VectorField()table = db.create_table(\"code_chunks\", schema=CodeChunks, mode=\"overwrite\")table.add([    {\"text\": \"print('hello world!')\", filename: \"hello.py\"},    {\"text\": \"print('goodbye world!')\", filename: \"goodbye.py\"}])query = \"greetings\"actual = table.search(query).limit(1).to_pydantic(CodeChunks)[0]print(actual.text)\n```\n\n<Check>\n  If you are indexing more than one repository, it is best to store these in\n  separate \"tables\" (terminology used by LanceDB) or \"collections\" (terminology\n  used by some other vector DBs). The alternative of adding a \"repository\" field\n  and then filtering by this is less performant.\n</Check>\n\nRegardless of which database or model you have chosen, your script should iterate over all of the files that you wish to index, chunk them, generate embeddings for each chunk, and then insert all of the chunks into your vector database.\n\n## Step 5: How to Run Your Indexing Script\n\n<Check>\n  In a perfect production version, you would want to build \"automatic, incremental indexing\", so that you whenever a file changes, that file and nothing else is automatically re-indexed. This has the benefits of perfectly up-to-date embeddings and lower cost.\n\nThat said, we highly recommend first building and testing the pipeline before attempting this. Unless your codebase is being entirely rewritten frequently, an incremental refresh of the index is likely to be sufficient and reasonably cheap.\n\n</Check>\n\nAt this point, you've written your indexing script and tested that you can make queries from your vector database. Now, you'll want a plan for when to run the indexing script.\n\nIn the beginning, you should probably run it by hand. Once you are confident that your custom RAG is providing value and is ready for the long-term, then you can set up a cron job to run it periodically. Because codebases are largely unchanged in short time frames, you won't want to re-index more than once a day. Once per week or month is probably even sufficient.\n\n## Step 6: How to set up an MCP server\n\nTo integrate your custom RAG system with Continue, you'll create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. MCP provides a standardized way for AI tools to access external resources.\n\n### Create your MCP server\n\nHere's a reference implementation using Python that queries your vector database:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"Custom RAG MCP server for code retrieval\"\"\"\nimport asyncio\nfrom mcp.server import Server\nfrom mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server\nfrom mcp.types import Tool, TextContent\nimport lancedb\n\n# Initialize your vector database connection\ndb = lancedb.connect(\"/path/to/your/db\")\ntable = db.open_table(\"code_chunks\")\n\napp = Server(\"custom-rag-server\")\n\n@app.tool()\nasync def search_codebase(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> list[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Search the codebase using vector similarity.\n    \n    Args:\n        query: The search query\n        limit: Maximum number of results to return\n    \"\"\"\n    # Query your vector database\n    results = table.search(query).limit(limit).to_list()\n    \n    # Format results for Continue\n    formatted_results = []\n    for result in results:\n        formatted_results.append(TextContent(\n            type=\"text\",\n            text=f\"File: {result['filename']}\\n\\n{result['text']}\"\n        ))\n    \n    return formatted_results\n\n@app.tool()\nasync def get_file_context(filename: str) -> list[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Get all chunks from a specific file.\n    \n    Args:\n        filename: The name of the file to retrieve\n    \"\"\"\n    results = table.where(f\"filename = '{filename}'\").to_list()\n    \n    return [TextContent(\n        type=\"text\",\n        text=\"\\n\".join([r['text'] for r in results])\n    )]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    stdio_server(app).run()\n```\n\n### Configure Continue to use your MCP server\n\nAdd your MCP server to Continue's configuration:\n\n**config.yaml:**\n```yaml\nmcpServers:\n  - name: custom-rag\n    command: python\n    args:\n      - /path/to/your/mcp_server.py\n    env:\n      VOYAGE_API_KEY: ${VOYAGE_API_KEY}\n```\n\n**config.json:**\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"custom-rag\",\n      \"command\": \"python\",\n      \"args\": [\"/path/to/your/mcp_server.py\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"VOYAGE_API_KEY\": \"${VOYAGE_API_KEY}\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Step 7 (Bonus): How to Set Up Reranking\n\nIf you'd like to improve the quality of your results, a great first step is to add reranking. This involves retrieving a larger initial pool of results from the vector database, and then using a reranking model to order them from most to least relevant. This works because the reranking model can perform a slightly more expensive calculation on the small set of top results, and so can give a more accurate ordering than similarity search, which has to search over all entries in the database.\n\nIf you wish to return 10 total results for each query for example, then you would:\n\n1. Retrieve \\~50 results from the vector database using similarity search\n2. Send all of these 50 results to the reranker API along with the query in order to get relevancy scores for each\n3.

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"docs/guides/ollama-guide.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Using Ollama with Continue: A Developer's Guide\"\ndescription: \"Complete guide to setting up Ollama with Continue for local AI development. Learn installation, configuration, model selection, performance optimization, and troubleshooting for privacy-focused offline coding assistance\"\n---\n\n## What Are the Prerequisites for Using Ollama\n\nBefore getting started, ensure your system meets these requirements:\n\n- Operating System: macOS, Linux, or Windows\n- RAM: Minimum 8GB (16GB+ recommended)\n- Storage: At least 10GB free space\n- Continue extension installed\n\n## How to Install Ollama - Step-by-Step\n\n### Step 1: Install Ollama\n\nChoose the installation method for your operating system:\n\n```\n# macOS\nbrew install ollama\n\n# Linux\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh\n\n# Windows\n# Download from ollama.ai\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start Ollama Service\n\nAfter installation, start the Ollama service:\n\n```bash\n# Check Ollama version - verify it's installed\nollama --version\n\n# Start Ollama (runs in background)\nollama serve\n\n# Verify it's running\ncurl http://localhost:11434\n# Should return \"Ollama is running\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Download Models\n\n<Warning>\n  **Important**: Always use `ollama pull` instead of `ollama run` to download\n  models. The `run` command starts an interactive session which isn't needed for\n  Continue.\n</Warning>\n\nDownload models using the exact tag specified:\n\n```bash\n# Pull models with specific tags\nollama pull deepseek-r1:32b       # 32B parameter version\nollama pull deepseek-r1:latest     # Latest/default version\nollama pull mistral:latest\nollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b\n\n# List all downloaded models\nollama list\n```\n\n**Common Model Tags:**\n\n- `:latest` - Default version (used if no tag specified)\n- `:32b`, `:7b`, `:1.5b` - Parameter count versions\n- `:instruct`, `:base` - Model variants\n\n<Note>\n  If a model page shows `deepseek-r1:32b` on Ollama's website, you must pull it\n  with that exact tag. Using just `deepseek-r1` will pull `:latest` which may be\n  a different size.\n</Note>\n\n## How to Configure Ollama with Continue\n\nThere are multiple ways to configure Ollama models in Continue:\n\n### Method 1: Using Hub Model Blocks in Local config.yaml\n\nThe easiest way is to use [pre-configured model blocks](/reference#local-blocks) from the Continue Mission Control in your local configuration:\n\n```yaml title=\"~/.continue/configs/config.yaml\"\nname: My Local Config\nversion: 0.0.1\nschema: v1\nmodels:\n  - uses: ollama/deepseek-r1-32b\n  - uses: ollama/qwen2.5-coder-7b\n  - uses: ollama/gpt-oss-20b\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  **Important**: Blocks only provide configuration - you still need to pull\n  the model locally. The block `ollama/deepseek-r1-32b` configures Continue\n  to use `model: deepseek-r1:32b`, but the actual model must be installed:\n  ```bash\n  # Check what the block expects (view on hub.continue.dev)\n  # Then pull that exact model tag locally\n  ollama pull deepseek-r1:32b  # Required for ollama/deepseek-r1-32b hub block\n  ```\n  If the model isn't installed, Ollama will return:\n  `404 model \"deepseek-r1:32b\" not found, try pulling it first`\n</Warning>\n\n### Method 2: Using Autodetect\n\nContinue can automatically detect available Ollama models. You can configure this in your YAML:\n\n```yaml title=\"~/.continue/config.yaml\"\nmodels:\n  - name: Autodetect\n    provider: ollama\n    model: AUTODETECT\n    roles:\n      - chat\n      - edit\n      - apply\n      - rerank\n      - autocomplete\n```\n\nOr use it through the GUI:\n\n1. Click on the model selector dropdown\n2. Select \"Autodetect\" option\n3. Continue will scan for available Ollama models\n4. Select your desired model from the detected list\n\n<Note>\n  The Autodetect feature scans your local Ollama installation and lists all\n  available models. When set to `AUTODETECT`, Continue will dynamically populate\n  the model list based on what's installed locally via `ollama list`. This is\n  useful for quickly switching between models without manual configuration. For\n  any roles not covered by the detected models, you may need to manually\n  configure them.\n</Note>\n\nYou can update `apiBase` with the IP address of a remote machine serving Ollama.\n\n### Method 3: Manual Configuration\n\nFor custom configurations or models not in Mission Control:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: DeepSeek R1 32B\n    provider: ollama\n    model: deepseek-r1:32b # Must match exactly what `ollama list` shows\n    apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n    roles:\n      - chat\n      - edit\n    capabilities: # Add if not auto-detected\n      - tool_use\n  - name: Qwen2.5-Coder 1.5B\n    provider: ollama\n    model: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b\n    roles:\n      - autocomplete\n```\n\n### Model Capabilities and Tool Support\n\nSome Ollama models support tools (function calling) which is required for Agent mode. However, not all models that claim tool support work correctly:\n\n#### Checking Tool Support\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: DeepSeek R1\n    provider: ollama\n    model: deepseek-r1:latest\n    capabilities:\n      - tool_use # Add this to enable tools\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  **Known Issue**: Some models like DeepSeek R1 may show \"Agent mode is not\n  supported\" or \"does not support tools\" even with capabilities configured. This\n  is a known limitation where the model's actual tool support differs from its\n  advertised capabilities.\n</Warning>\n\n#### If Agent Mode Shows \"Not Supported\"\n\n![agent not supported](/images/guides/images/agent-not-supported.png)\n\n1. First, add `capabilities: [tool_use]` to your model config\n2. If you still get errors, the model may not actually support tools despite documentation\n3. Use a different model known to work with tools (e.g., Llama 3.1, Mistral)\n4. Alternatively, you can turn on [System Message tools](/ide-extensions/agent/model-setup#how-system-message-tools-work)\n\nSee the [Model Capabilities guide](/customize/deep-dives/model-capabilities) for more details.\n\n### How to Configure Advanced Settings\n\nFor optimal performance, consider these advanced configuration options:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: Optimized DeepSeek\n    provider: ollama\n    model: deepseek-r1:32b\n    contextLength: 8192 # Adjust context window (default varies by model)\n    completionOptions:\n      temperature: 0.7 # Controls randomness (0.0-1.0)\n      top_p: 0.9 # Nucleus sampling threshold\n      top_k: 40 # Top-k sampling\n      num_predict: 2048 # Max tokens to generate\n    # Ollama-specific options (set via environment or modelfile)\n    # num_gpu: 35        # Number of GPU layers to offload\n    # num_thread: 8      # CPU threads to use\n```\n\nFor GPU acceleration and memory tuning, create an Ollama Modelfile:\n\n```\n# Create custom model with optimizations\nFROM deepseek-r1:32b\nPARAMETER num_gpu 35\nPARAMETER num_thread 8\nPARAMETER num_ctx 4096\n```\n\n## What Are the Best Practices for Ollama\n\n### How to Choose the Right Model\n\nChoose models based on your specific needs (see [recommended models](/customize/models#recommended-models) for more options):\n\n1. **Code Generation**:\n\n   - `qwen2.5-coder:7b` - Excellent for code completion\n   - `codellama:13b` - Strong general coding support\n   - `deepseek-coder:6.7b` - Fast and efficient\n\n2. **Chat & Reasoning**:\n\n   - `llama3.1:8b` - Latest Llama with tool support\n   - `mistral:7b` - Fast and versatile\n   - `deepseek-r1:32b` - Advanced reasoning capabilities\n\n3. **Autocomplete**:\n\n   - `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` - Lightweight and fast\n   - `starcoder2:3b` - Optimized for code completion\n\n4. **Memory Requirements**:\n   - 1.5B-3B models: ~4GB RAM\n   - 7B models: ~8GB RAM\n   - 13B models: ~16GB RAM\n   - 32B models: ~32GB RAM\n\n### How to Optimize Performance\n\nTo get the best performance from Ollama:\n\n- Monitor system resources with `ollama ps` to see memory usage\n- Adjust context window size based on available RAM\n- Use appropriate model sizes for your hardware\n- Enable GPU acceleration when available (NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm)\n- Use `ollama logs` to debug performance issues\n\n## How to Troubleshoot Ollama Issues\n\n### Common Configuration Problems\n\n#### \"404 model not found, try pulling it first\"\n\nThis error occurs when the model isn't installed locally:\n\n**Problem**: Using a hub block or config that references a model not yet pulled\n**Solution**:\n\n```bash\n# Check what models you have\nollama list\n\n# Pull the exact model version needed\nollama pull model-name:tag  # e.g., deepseek-r1:32b\n```\n\n#### Model Tag Mismatches\n\n**Problem**: `ollama pull deepseek-r1` installs `:latest` but hub block expects `:32b`\n**Solution**: Always pull with the exact tag:\n\n```bash\n# Wrong - pulls :latest\nollama pull deepseek-r1\n\n# Right - pulls specific version\nollama pull deepseek-r1:32b\n```\n\n#### \"Agent mode is not supported\"\n\n**Problem**: Model doesn't support tools/function calling\n**Solutions**:\n\n1. Add `capabilities: [tool_use]` to your model config\n2. If still not working, the model may not actually support tools\n3. Switch to a model with confirmed tool support (Llama 3.1, Mistral)\n\n#### Using Hub Blocks in Local Config\n\n**Problem**: Unclear how to use hub models locally\n**Solution**: Create a local agent file:\n\n```yaml\n# ~/.continue/configs/config.yaml\nname: Local Config\nversion: 0.0.1\nschema: v1\nmodels:\n  - uses: ollama/model-name\n```\n\n### How to Fix Connection Problems\n\n- Verify Ollama is running: `curl http://localhost:11434`\n- Check service status: `systemctl status ollama` (Linux)\n- Ensure port 11434 is not blocked by firewall\n- For remote connections, set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434`\n\n### How to Resolve Performance Issues\n\n- Insufficient RAM: Use smaller models (7B instead of 32B)\n- Model too large: Check available memory with `ollama ps`\n- GPU issues: Verify CUDA/ROCm installation for GPU acceleration\n- Slow generation: Adjust `num_gpu` layers in model configuration\n- Check system diagnostics: `ollama ps` for active models and memory usage\n\n## What Are Example Workflows with Ollama\n\n### How to Use Ollama for Code Generation\n\n```python\n# Example: Generate a FastAPI endpoint\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    age: int\n\n@app.post(\"/users/\")\nasync def create_user(user: User):\n    # Continue will help complete this implementation\n    # Use Cmd+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux) to generate code\n    pass\n```\n\n### How to Use Ollama for Code Review\n\nUse Continue with Ollama to:\n\n- Analyze code quality\n- Suggest improvements\n- Identify potential bugs\n- Generate documentation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOllama with Continue provides a powerful local development environment for AI-assisted coding. You now have complete control over your AI models, ensuring privacy and enabling offline development workflows.\n\n---\n\n_This guide is based on Ollama v0.11.x and Continue v1.1.x.

Plan accordingly.`\n2. **Share technical constraints**: `We're on AWS with strict security requirements. Plan a file upload system that meets SOC2 compliance.`\n3. **Ask for risk analysis**: `What could go wrong with this database migration? Plan rollback procedures.`\n4. **Request multiple perspectives**: `Show me 3 different approaches to implementing caching in this API, with pros and cons for each.`\n\n## How to Enable Plan Mode\n\nYou can switch to `Plan` in the mode selector below the chat input box.\n\n![How to select plan mode](../images/plan-mode-selector.png)\n\n## What Tools Are Available in Plan Mode?\n\n| Tool                              | Available | Description                                          |\n| :-------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |\n| **File/directory reading**        | ✅        | Browse and read any file or folder in your workspace |\n| **Grep/glob search**              | ✅        | Search for patterns across files and directories     |\n| **Repository structure analysis** | ✅        | Understand codebase organization and dependencies    |\n| **Git history/diffs**             | ✅        | Review commits, branches, and changes                |\n| **Web content fetching**          | ✅        | Access external documentation and resources          |\n| **External API access**           | ✅        | Read-only calls to external services                 |\n| **MCP tools**                     | ✅        | Model Context Protocol integrations                  |\n| **Database schema examination**   | ✅        | Analyze database structure (read-only)               |\n| **File creation/editing**         | ❌        | Creating or modifying files                          |\n| **Terminal command execution**    | ❌        | Running shell commands                               |\n| **System modifications**          | ❌        | Changing system settings or configurations           |\n| **Package installation**          | ❌        | Installing dependencies or packages                  |\n| **Git commits/pushes**            | ❌        | Making changes to version control                    |\n| **Database modifications**        | ❌        | Altering database data or structure                  |\n\n## How Context Integration Works in Plan Mode\n\nContext is the foundation of effective planning.

The Continue agent automatically calls the appropriate Chrome DevTools MCP tools.\n\n<Info>\n  **Where to run these workflows:**\n  - **IDE Extensions**: Use Continue in VS Code, JetBrains, or other supported IDEs\n  - **Terminal (TUI mode)**: Run `cn` to enter interactive mode, then type your prompts\n  - **CLI (headless mode)**: Use `cn -p \"your prompt\"` for headless commands\n\n  **Test in Plan Mode First**: Before running performance measurements, test your prompts in plan mode (see the [Plan Mode Guide](/guides/plan-mode-guide); press **Shift+Tab** to switch modes). This shows you what the agent will do without executing it.\n</Info>\n\n### Step 1: Baseline Performance Trace\n\nEstablish your current performance baseline:\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nNavigate to http://localhost:3000 and record a performance trace with page reload. Analyze the trace and show me the LCP, FID, CLS, and total blocking time.\n```\n\n\n<Info>\n\n    Chrome DevTools Performance Panel automatically tracks:\n    - **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS, INP\n    - **Loading Performance**: DOMContentLoaded, Load events, First Paint\n    - **Runtime Performance**: JavaScript execution time, layout shifts, paint events\n    - **Resource Usage**: Memory consumption, CPU utilization\n\n</Info>\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Performance Insights\n\nDeep dive into specific performance issues:\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nRecord a performance trace for http://localhost:3000 and analyze all Performance Insights. For each insight found, provide detailed information about:\n- The specific issue (e.g., DocumentLatency, SlowCSS)\n- Root cause analysis\n- Affected resources or code\n- Recommended optimizations\n- Expected impact on Core Web Vitals\n```\n\n<Info>\n  **Performance Insights**: Chrome DevTools automatically detects common performance issues like:\n  - **Render Blocking Resources**: CSS and JavaScript that delay first paint\n  - **Layout Shifts**: Elements that move during page load\n  - **Long Tasks**: JavaScript execution blocking the main thread\n  - **Slow Network Requests**: Resources taking too long to load\n  - **Unused CSS/JavaScript**: Dead code increasing bundle size\n</Info>\n\n### Step 3: Network Performance Analysis\n\nIdentify slow network requests and optimization opportunities:\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nNavigate to https://my-site.com and:\n1. List all network requests made during page load\n2. Identify the 5 slowest requests and their sizes\n3. Find any requests over 1MB\n4. Detect render-blocking resources\n5. Check for inefficient caching (missing cache headers)\n6. Suggest specific optimizations for each issue found\n```\n\n### Step 4: Throttling Performance Tests\n\nTest performance under real-world network and CPU conditions:\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nTest my site's performance under different conditions:\n\n1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000\n2. Emulate 4x CPU slowdown and Fast 3G network\n3. Record a performance trace with reload\n4. Analyze LCP and Total Blocking Time\n5. Take a screenshot when page is fully loaded\n\nThen repeat the test with:\n- Slow 3G network + 6x CPU slowdown\n- Offline network (to test service worker)\n\nCompare results and identify which conditions cause the worst performance degradation.\"\n```\n\n<Info>\n  **Available Network Presets**:\n  - No throttling\n  - Fast 3G (1.6 Mbps down, 0.75 Mbps up)\n  - Slow 3G (400 Kbps down, 400 Kbps up)\n  - Offline\n\n  **CPU Throttling**: 4x, 6x, or custom slowdown to simulate low-end devices\n</Info>\n\n### Step 5: JavaScript Performance Analysis\n\nIdentify expensive JavaScript operations:\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nRecord a performance trace for http://localhost:3000 and:\n1. Identify all long tasks (>50ms) blocking the main thread\n2. Find the specific JavaScript functions causing these tasks\n3. Measure total JavaScript execution time\n4. Detect unused JavaScript being loaded\n5. Show the call stack for the longest task\n6. Recommend code splitting or lazy loading opportunities\"\n```\n\n## Automated Performance Monitoring\n\n### Step 6: Core Web Vitals Dashboard\n\nCreate automated monitoring for Core Web Vitals:\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nCreate a performance monitoring script that:\n1. Opens my site at http://localhost:3000\n2. Records a performance trace with reload\n3. Extracts Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, INP)\n4. Checks console for JavaScript errors\n5. Takes a screenshot\n6. Saves results to performance-report.json with format:\n   {\n     'timestamp': 'ISO date',\n     'lcp': number,\n     'fid': number,\n     'cls': number,\n     'inp': number,\n     'errors': array,\n     'screenshot': 'path'\n   }\n\nSave this as scripts/performance-monitor.js that I can run regularly\"\n```\n\n### Step 7: Visual Regression Detection\n\nDetect unintended visual changes:\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nSet up visual regression testing:\n1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000\n2. Take full-page screenshots at:\n   - Desktop viewport (1920x1080)\n   - Tablet viewport (768x1024)\n   - Mobile viewport (375x667)\n3. Save screenshots to screenshots/baseline/\n4. Create a script to compare future screenshots against baseline\n5. Highlight any pixel differences over 5%\n6. Generate a visual diff report\"\n```\n\n### Step 8: Performance Budget Enforcement\n\nSet and enforce performance budgets:\n\n**TUI Mode Prompt:**\n```\nCreate a performance budget checker that:\n\nRequirements:\n- LCP must be < 2.5 seconds\n- FID must be < 100ms\n- CLS must be < 0.1\n- Total JavaScript < 300KB\n- Total page size < 1MB\n- No console errors\n\nImplementation:\n1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000\n2. Record performance trace with reload\n3. List all network requests and calculate total sizes\n4. Check console messages for errors\n5. Validate all metrics against budgets\n6. Exit with code 1 if any budget is exceeded\n7. Generate a detailed report showing pass/fail for each metric\n\nSave as scripts/performance-budget.js for CI/CD integration\"\n```\n\n## Continuous Performance Testing with GitHub Actions\n\nThis example demonstrates a **Continuous AI workflow** where performance validation runs automatically in your CI/CD pipeline using Chrome DevTools MCP in headless mode.\n\n### Add GitHub Secrets\n\nNavigate to **Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:\n\n- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Your Continue API key from [hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys](https://hub.continue.dev/settings/api-keys)\n\n### Create Workflow File\n\nThis workflow automatically validates web performance on pull requests using the Continue CLI in headless mode. It records performance traces, extracts Core Web Vitals, and posts a summary report as a PR comment.\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/performance-check.yml` in your repository:\n\n```yaml\nname: Performance Check\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  performance:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: \"20\"\n\n      - name: Install Dependencies\n        run: |\n          npm install -g @continuedev/cli\n          npm ci\n\n      - name: Build Project\n        run: npm run build\n\n      - name: Start Dev Server\n        run: |\n          npm run dev &\n          npx wait-on http://localhost:3000\n\n      - name: Run Performance Tests\n        env:\n          CONTINUE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONTINUE_API_KEY }}\n        run: |\n          cn --agent continuedev/chrome-dev-tools-agent \\\n             -p \"Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and:\n             1.

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"docs/guides/continuous-ai.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Continuous AI: A Developer's Guide\"\ndescription: \"Learn how to integrate intelligent automation into development workflows, making AI assistance as natural as syntax highlighting. Implement systematic AI workflows that compound productivity gains over time.\"\n---\n\nContinuous AI is the integration of intelligent automation directly into development workflows, making AI assistance as natural and reliable as syntax highlighting or code completion. Its purpose is to amplify developer intent at every stage of the coding process.\n\nThink of it this way: DevOps automated the mechanical aspects of software delivery—building, testing, deploying. Continuous AI automates the intelligence aspects—understanding context, making suggestions, adapting to patterns, and learning from developer feedback.\n\n## Why Continuous AI Matters Now\n\nThe same market forces that made DevOps inevitable are now driving Continuous AI adoption:\n\n<CardGroup>\n  <Card title=\"Developer Behavior is Shifting\" icon=\"chart-line\">\n    Engineering teams are rapidly adopting AI tools, with many seeing\n    significant productivity improvements in their workflows.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Economic Pressure\" icon=\"dollar-sign\">\n  AI-assisted coding is contributing measurable increases in developer output,\n  creating competitive advantages for early adopters.\n</Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Tooling Maturity\" icon=\"wrench\">\n    Unlike DevOps, Continuous AI can be implemented incrementally on existing\n    development stacks without major infrastructure changes.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\nThe teams that implement systematic AI workflows first create advantages that compound over time.\n\n## The Continuous AI Maturity Model\n\nTeams typically progress through three stages when adopting Continuous AI:\n\n<Accordion title=\"Level 1: Manual AI Assistance\">\nYou prompt the AI when you remember, and it completes the task. This is great for quick productivity boosts but remains highly manual and inconsistent.\n\n**Example**: Using AI to draft a function or suggest a test case only when you think to ask for it.\n\n**Continue Implementation**: Using [Chat](/ide-extensions/chat/quick-start) or [Edit](/ide-extensions/edit/quick-start) mode for one-off coding tasks.\n\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Level 2: Workflow Automation\">\nAI handles routine tasks with human oversight. This is where teams start seeing compounding gains.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- AI adds missing documentation during PR review\n- Automatic code formatting and style corrections\n- Generated unit tests for new functions\n- Updated issue tracking when branches are merged\n\n**Continue Implementation**: Using [Continue CLI](/guides/cli) with custom rules and integrations into CI/CD pipelines.\n\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Level 3: Zero-Intervention Workflows\">\nAI autonomously completes processes end-to-end without human input, but only for very specific, low-risk workflows.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- AI merges safe dependency updates after automated tests pass\n- Automatic documentation updates when code changes\n- Self-healing test suites that fix themselves based on failure patterns\n\n**Continue Implementation**: Fully automated [agents](/ide-extensions/agent/quick-start) with strict permissions and safety guardrails.\n\n</Accordion>\n\n## Building Your Continuous AI Workflow\n\n### Start with Level 1 → Level 2: Pick One Workflow\n\nDon't try to automate everything at once. Choose a specific daily friction point:\n\n```bash\n# Example: Automated code review comments\ngit diff | cn -p \"review this diff and suggest improvements following our team standards\"\n\n# Example: Generate missing tests\ncn -p \"create unit tests for the functions in src/auth.js\"\n\n# Example: Update documentation\ncn -p \"update the README with the new API endpoints from the recent changes\"\n```\n\n### Configure Team-Wide Intelligence\n\nThe most effective Continuous AI is tuned to your codebase, standards, and practices:\n\n```yaml config.yaml\nrules:\n  - name: code-review\n    description: \"Review code following team standards\"\n    rule: \"Review following our TypeScript style guide and security practices\"\n    context:\n      - \"docs/style-guide.md\"\n      - \"security-checklist.md\"\n```\n\n### Implement Progressive Permissions\n\nUse Continue CLI's permission system to gradually expand AI capabilities:\n\n```yaml ~/.continue/permissions.yaml\npermissions:\n  - allow: \"Bash(git*)\" # Git commands are safe\n  - ask: \"Write(**/*.ts)\" # Ask before modifying TypeScript files\n  - deny: \"Bash(rm*)\" # Never allow deletions\n```\n\n### Measure What Matters: Intervention Rate\n\nTrack how often you need to correct AI output. Lower intervention rates mean higher trust and compounding productivity gains.\n\n## Real-World Implementation Patterns\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Pattern 1: The Async Triage Bot\">\n    Imagine setting up an AI agent that checks new GitHub issues every morning and leaves the first helpful response. This lightens the load for maintainers and ensures community members feel heard quickly.\n  </Accordion>\n\n    <Accordion title=\"Pattern 2: The PR Review Agent\">\n    AI can automatically review new pull requests for security, performance, and style issues. The reviewer still has the final say, but the agent highlights common problems and speeds up the feedback loop.\n\n  </Accordion>\n    <Accordion title=\"Pattern 3: The Documentation Guardian\">\n    Whenever code changes, AI can scan for mismatches in documentation and suggest updates. This keeps docs current without relying on developers to remember every detail.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n## Best Practices for Sustainable Continuous AI\n\n<CardGroup>\n  <Card title=\"Human-AI Collaboration\" icon=\"handshake\">\n    AI should amplify human intelligence, not replace it. Always validate AI\n    suggestions rather than blindly accepting them.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Start Small, Scale Thoughtfully\" icon=\"seedling\">\n  Begin with low-risk, high-value automations. Gradually expand as you build\n  trust and understanding.\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Customize for Your Context\" icon=\"cog\">\n  Generic AI suggestions are often wrong or irrelevant. Configure AI to\n  understand your specific patterns and requirements.\n</Card>\n\n  <Card title=\"Build Safety Guardrails\" icon=\"shield\">\n    Use permission systems, code review processes, and testing to ensure AI\n    actions are safe and reversible.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n<Warning>\n  **Over-automation**: Don't automate processes you don't fully understand\n</Warning>\n\n<Warning>\n  **Ignoring Context**: AI works best when it understands your codebase and team\n  practices\n</Warning>\n\n<Warning>\n  **Skipping Safety**: Always implement proper permissions and review processes\n</Warning>\n\n<Warning>\n  **Vanity Metrics**: Focus on intervention rate and actual time saved, not \"AI\n  suggestions generated\"\n</Warning>\n\n## Getting Started Today\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Install Continue CLI\">\n    ```bash npm i -g @continuedev/cli ```\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Pick One Workflow\">Choose a daily friction point to automate</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Set Permissions\">Configure safe boundaries for AI actions</Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Measure Impact\">Track intervention rates and time saved</Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Iterate and Expand\">Gradually add more automated workflows</Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## The Competitive Advantage\n\nTeams implementing Continuous AI are coding faster and building institutional intelligence that scales with their organization. While others manually perform routine tasks, your AI handles the repetitive work so your team can focus on innovation and complex problem-solving.\n\n## What's Next?\n\nAs AI capabilities continue to improve and tooling matures, we're moving toward a world where intelligent assistance is as fundamental to development as version control or IDEs. The teams that start building these capabilities now will have refined systems, cultural readiness, and institutional knowledge when Continuous AI becomes the industry standard.\n\nReady to amplify your development workflow with Continuous AI? Start with one simple automation and build from there.\n\n<Card title=\"Want to dive deeper?\" icon=\"rocket\">\n      Check out our guides on [Continue CLI](/guides/cli) and [Understanding\n    Configs](/guides/understanding-configs).\n</Card>\n"}

If you do not have an existing IBM Cloud account, you can sign up for a free trial.\n\nTo authenticate to watsonx.ai SaaS with Continue, you will need to create a project and [set up an API key](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mas-cd/continuous-delivery?topic=cli-creating-your-cloud-api-key). Then, in continue:\n\n- Set **apiBase** to your watsonx SaaS endpoint, e.g. `https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com` for US South region.\n- Set **projectId** to your watsonx project ID.\n- Set **apiKey** to your watsonx API Key.\n\n### watsonx.ai Software\n\nTo authenticate to your watsonx.ai Software instance with Continue, you can use either `username/password` or `ZenApiKey` method:\n\n1. _Option 1_ (Recommended): using `ZenApiKey` authentication:\n   - Set **apiBase** to your watsonx software endpoint, e.g. `https://cpd-watsonx.apps.example.com`.\n   - Set **projectId** to your watsonx project ID.\n   - Set **apiKey** to your watsonx Zen API Key. To generate it:\n     1. Log in to the CPD web client.\n     2. From the toolbar, click your avatar.\n     3. Click **Profile and settings**.\n     4. Click **API key** > **Generate new key**.\n     5. Click **Generate**.\n     6. Click **Copy** and save your key somewhere safe. You cannot recover this key if you lose it.\n     7.

Just download the app from the website, click a button, and you are up and running.

Higher values result in more creative but potentially less coherent outputs, while lower values lead to more predictable and focused outputs.\n- top_p: options.topP - This sets a threshold (between 0 and 1) to control how diverse the predicted tokens should be. The model generates tokens that are likely according to their probability distribution, but also considers the top-k most probable tokens.\n- top_k: options.topK - This parameter limits the number of unique tokens to consider when generating the next token in the sequence. Higher values increase the variety of generated sequences, while lower values lead to more focused outputs.\n- num_predict: options.maxTokens - This determines the maximum number of tokens (words or characters) to generate for the given input prompt.\n- num_thread: options.numThreads - This is the multi-threading configuration option that controls how many threads the model uses for parallel processing. Higher values may lead to faster generation times but could also increase memory usage and complexity. Set this to one or two lower than the number of threads your CPU can handle to leave some for your GUI when running the model locally.\n- use_mmap: options.useMmap - For Ollama, this parameter allows the model to be mapped into memory. If disabled can enhance response time on low end devices but will slow down the stream.\n\n## Authentication\n\nIf you need to send custom headers for authentication, you may use the `requestOptions.headers` property like this:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  models:\n    - name: Msty\n      provider: msty\n      model: deepseek-coder:6.7b\n      requestOptions:\n        headers:\n          Authorization: Bearer xxx\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"models\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Msty\",\n        \"provider\": \"msty\",\n        \"model\": \"deepseek-coder:6.7b\",\n        \"requestOptions\": {\n          \"headers\": {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer xxx\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n[View the source](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/llm/llms/Msty.ts)\n"}

cloud services?\n2. **Performance requirements**: Different providers offer varying levels of speed, quality, and context length.\n3. **Specific capabilities**: Some models excel at code generation, others at embeddings or reasoning tasks.\n4. **Pricing**: Costs vary significantly between providers, from free local options to premium cloud services.\n5. **API key requirements**: Most cloud providers require API keys that you'll need to configure.\n\n## Configuration Format\n\nYou can add models to your `config.yaml` file like this:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: Claude 4 Sonnet\n    provider: anthropic # Choose provider from the lists above\n    model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514 # Specific model name\n    apiKey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}\n    roles:\n      - chat\n      - edit\n      - apply\n```\nFor more detailed configuration, visit the specific provider pages linked above.\n\n## Change Your Model Provider\n\nContinue allows you to choose your favorite or even add multiple model providers. This allows you to use different models for different tasks, or to try another model if you’re not happy with the results from your current model. Continue supports all of the popular model providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft/Azure, Mistral, and more. You can even self host your own model provider if you’d like.

You type '@Issue' and select the one you are working on. Continue can now see the issue title and contents. You also know that the issue is related to the files 'readme.md' and 'helloNested.py', so you type '@readme' and '@hello' to find and select them. Now these 3 \"Context Items\" are displayed inline with the rest of your input.\n\n![Context Items](/images/customize/images/context-provider-example-0c96ff77286fa970b23dddfdc1fa986a.png)\n\n## Built-in Context Providers\n\nYou can add any built-in context-providers in your config file as shown below:\n\n### @File Context Provider – Reference Files in Your Workspace\n\nReference any file in your current workspace.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:  - provider: file\n```\n\n### @Code Context Provider – Reference Functions and Classes\n\nReference specific functions or classes from throughout your project.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:  - provider: code\n```\n\n### @Git Diff Context Provider – Reference Branch Changes\n\nReference all of the changes you've made to your current branch. This is useful if you want to summarize what you've done or ask for a general review of your work before committing.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:  - provider: diff\n```\n\n### @Current File Context Provider – Reference the Active File\n\nReference the currently open file.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:  - provider: currentFile\n```\n\n### @Terminal Context Provider – Reference Last Terminal Command and Output\n\nReference the last command you ran in your IDE's terminal and its output.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:  - provider: terminal\n```\n\n### @Docs Context Provider – Reference Documentation Site Content\n\nReference the contents from any documentation site.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:  - provider: docs\n```\n\nNote that this will only enable the `@Docs` context provider.\n\nTo use it, you need to add a documentation site to your config file. See the [docs](/customize/overview#documentation-context) page for more information.\n\n### @Open Context Provider – Reference All Open Files or Pinned Files\n\nReference the contents of all of your open files. Set `onlyPinned` to `true` to only reference pinned files.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: open\n    params:\n      onlyPinned: true\n```\n\n### @Web Context Provider – Reference Relevant Web Pages\n\nReference relevant pages from across the web, automatically determined from your input.\n\nOptionally, set `n` to limit the number of results returned (default 6).\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: web\n    params:\n      n: 5\n```\n\n### @Codebase Context Provider – Reference Relevant Codebase Snippets\n\nReference the most relevant snippets from your codebase.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: codebase\n```\n\nRead more about indexing and retrieval [here](/customize/overview#codebase-context).\n\n### @Folder Context Provider – Reference Code from a Specific Folder\n\nUses the same retrieval mechanism as `@Codebase`, but only on a single folder.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:  - provider: folder\n```\n\n### @Search Context Provider – Reference Code Search Results\n\nReference the results of codebase search, just like the results you would get from VS Code search.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: search\n    params:\n      maxResults: 100 # optional, defaults to 200\n```\n\nThis context provider is powered by [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).\n\n### @Url Context Provider – Reference Content from a URL\n\nReference the markdown converted contents of a given URL.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: url\n```\n\n### @Clipboard Context Provider – Reference Clipboard Items\n\nReference recent clipboard items\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: clipboard\n```\n\n### @Tree Context Provider – Reference Workspace File Structure\n\nReference the structure of your current workspace.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: tree\n```\n\n### @Problems Context Provider – Reference Problems in the Current File\n\nGet Problems from the current file.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: problems\n```\n\n### @Debugger Context Provider – Reference Debugger Local Variables\n\nReference the contents of the local variables in the debugger. Currently only available in VS Code.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: debugger\n    params:\n      stackDepth: 3\n```\n\nUses the top _n_ levels (defaulting to 3) of the call stack for that thread.\n\n### @Repository Map Context Provider – Reference Codebase Outline and Signatures\n\nReference the outline of your codebase. By default, signatures are included along with file in the repo map.\n\n`includeSignatures` params can be set to false to exclude signatures. This could be necessary for large codebases and/or to reduce context size significantly. Signatures will not be included if indexing is disabled.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: repo-map\n    params:\n      includeSignatures: false # default true\n```\n\nProvides a list of files and the call signatures of top-level classes, functions, and methods in those files. This helps the model better understand how a particular piece of code relates to the rest of the codebase.\n\nIn the submenu that appears, you can select either `Entire codebase`, or specify a subfolder to generate the repository map from.\n\nThis context provider is inspired by [Aider's repository map](https://aider.chat/2023/10/22/repomap.html).\n\n### @Operating System Context Provider – Reference System Architecture and Platform\n\nReference the architecture and platform of your current operating system.\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\ncontext:\n  - provider: os\n```\n\n### Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Continue\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standard proposed by Anthropic to unify prompts, context, and tool use. Continue supports any MCP server with the MCP context provider. Read their [quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) to learn how to set up a local server and then set up your configuration like this:\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\nmcpServers:\n  - name: My MCP Server\n    command: uvx\n    args:\n      - mcp-server-sqlite\n      - --db-path\n      - /Users/NAME/test.db\n```\n\nYou'll then be able to type \"@\" and see \"MCP\" in the context providers dropdown.\n\n### How to Request a New Context Provider in Continue\n\nNot seeing what you want?

Supabase).\n\n...\n```\n\n<Info>You can read the rest of the `Create Supabase functions` prompt [here](http://hub.continue.dev/supabase/create-functions)</Info>\n\nIf you are using a local `config.yaml`, you can add it to your config like this:\n\n```md title=\"config.yaml\"\n...\n\nprompts:\n  - uses: supabase/create-functions\n\n...\n```\n\nIf you are using Continue Mission Control, you can add it to your config by selecting \"Use Rule\" [here](https://hub.continue.dev/supabase/create-functions)\n\nTo use this prompt, you can open Chat / Agent / Edit, type <kbd>/</kbd>, select the prompt, and type out any additional instructions you'd like to add.\n\n## Using a prompt with `cn (TUI mode)`\n\nYou can run this command to start [cn](../../guides/cli) with the [Create Supabase functions](http://hub.continue.dev/supabase/create-functions) prompt.\n\n```\ncn --prompt supabase/create-functions \"I need a function that checks for the health status\"\n```\nAlternatively, you can start [cn](../../guides/cli) and then type <kbd>/</kbd> to manually invoke the prompt yourself.\n\n## Using a prompt to kick off a Continuous AI workflow with `cn (Headless mode)\n\nYou can kick off Continuous AI workflows using a prompt with [cn](../../guides/cli) by adding the `-p` flag.\n\nFor example, say you are building a SaaS application and must repeatedly create custom Supabase validation functions for each new feature that accepts user input. \n\nThese functions require you to interpret business requirements, implement complex cross-table logic (like checking user permissions, tier limits, and time-based restrictions), and make judgment calls about edge cases. \n\nEach function is unique enough that it can't be templated or scripted. This is where kicking off a Continuous AI workflow to get you started can be quite helpful.\n\nHere is a command that you could run whenever you have a new feature:\n\n```\n cn -p --prompt supabase/create-functions \"I need a function for the new feature on my current branch similar to my existing database functions\"\n```\n\n<Info>You can see the entire `Create Supabase functions` prompt [here](http://hub.continue.dev/supabase/create-functions)</Info>\n\nWhen you run this workflow, [cn](../../guides/cli) will checkout your current branch, explore the new and existing code, and then draft a function for you.\n\nYou will then be able to review the implementation and improve it before you merge the new feature."}

This guide explains how model capabilities work and how to configure them.\n\n## What Are Model Capabilities?\n\nModel capabilities tell Continue what features a model supports:\n\n- **`tool_use`** - Whether the model can use tools and functions\n- **`image_input`** - Whether the model can process images\n\nWithout proper capability configuration, you may encounter issues like:\n\n- Agent mode being unavailable (requires tools)\n- Tools not working at all\n- Image uploads being disabled\n\n## How Continue Detects Model Capabilities\n\nContinue uses a two-tier system for determining model capabilities:\n\n### How Automatic Detection Works (Default)\n\nContinue automatically detects capabilities based on your provider and model name. For example:\n\n- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo models support tools\n- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5+ models support both tools and images\n- **Ollama**: Most models support tools, vision models support images\n- **Google**: All Gemini models support function calling\n\nThis works well for popular models, but may not cover custom deployments or newer models.\n\nFor implementation details, see:\n\n- [toolSupport.ts](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/llm/toolSupport.ts) - Tool capability detection logic\n- [@continuedev/llm-info](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@continuedev/llm-info) - Image support detection\n\n### How to Configure Capabilities Manually\n\nYou can add capabilities to models that Continue doesn't automatically detect in your `config.yaml`.\n\n<Note>\n  You cannot override autodetection - you can only add capabilities. Continue\n  will always use its built-in knowledge about your model in addition to any\n  capabilities you specify.\n</Note>\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: my-custom-gpt4\n    provider: openai\n    apiBase: https://my-deployment.com/v1\n    model: gpt-4-custom\n    capabilities:\n      - tool_use\n      - image_input\n```\n\n## When to Add Capabilities Manually\n\nAdd capabilities when:\n\n1. **Using custom deployments** - Your API endpoint serves a model with different capabilities than the standard version\n2. **Using newer models** - Continue doesn't yet recognize a newly released model\n3. **Experiencing issues** - Autodetection isn't working correctly for your setup\n4. **Using proxy services** - Some proxy services modify model capabilities\n\n## How to Configure Model Capabilities (Examples)\n\n### How to Add Basic Tool Support\n\nAdd tool support for a model that Continue doesn't recognize:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: custom-model\n    provider: openai\n    model: my-fine-tuned-gpt4\n    capabilities:\n      - tool_use\n```\n\n<Info>\n  The `tool_use` capability is for native tool/function calling support. The\n  model must actually support tools for this to work.\n</Info>\n\n<Warning>\n  **Experimental**: System message tools are available as an experimental\n  feature for models without native tool support. These are not automatically\n  used as a fallback and must be explicitly configured. Most models are trained\n  for native tools, so system message tools may not work as well.\n</Warning>\n\n### How to Handle Models with Limited Capabilities\n\nExplicitly set no capabilities (autodetection will still apply):\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: limited-claude\n    provider: anthropic\n    model: claude-4.0-sonnet\n    capabilities: [] # Empty array doesn't disable autodetection\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  An empty capabilities array does not disable autodetection. Continue will\n  still detect and use the model's actual capabilities. To truly limit a model's\n  capabilities, you would need to use a model that doesn't support those\n  features.\n</Warning>\n\n### How to Enable Multiple Capabilities\n\nEnable both tools and image support:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: multimodal-gpt\n    provider: openai\n    model: gpt-4-vision-preview\n    capabilities:\n      - tool_use\n      - image_input\n```\n\n## Common Configuration Scenarios\n\nSome providers and custom deployments may require explicit capability configuration:\n\n- **OpenRouter**: May not preserve the original model's capabilities\n- **Custom API endpoints**: May have different capabilities than standard models\n- **Local models**: May need explicit capabilities if using non-standard model names\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: custom-deployment\n    provider: openai\n    apiBase: https://custom-api.company.com/v1\n    model: custom-gpt\n    capabilities:\n      - tool_use # If supports function calling\n      - image_input # If supports vision\n```\n\n## How to Troubleshoot Capability Issues\n\nFor troubleshooting capability-related issues like Agent mode being unavailable or tools not working, see the [Troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting#agent-mode-is-unavailable-or-tools-aren’t-working).\n\n## Best Practices for Model Capabilities\n\n1. **Start with autodetection** - Only override if you experience issues\n2. **Test after changes** - Verify tools and images work as expected\n3. **Keep Continue updated** - Newer versions improve autodetection\n\nRemember: Setting capabilities only adds to autodetection. Continue will still use its built-in knowledge about your model in addition to your specified capabilities.\n\n## Model Capability Support\n\nThis matrix shows which models support tool use and image input capabilities. Continue auto-detects these capabilities, but you can override them if needed.\n\n### OpenAI\n\n| Model         | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :------------ | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| GPT-5.1       | Yes      | No          | 400k           |\n| GPT-5         | Yes      | No          | 400k           |\n| o3            | Yes      | No          | 128k           |\n| o3-mini       | Yes      | No          | 128k           |\n| GPT-4o        | Yes      | Yes         | 128k           |\n| GPT-4 Turbo   | Yes      | Yes         | 128k           |\n| GPT-4         | Yes      | No          | 8k             |\n| GPT-3.5 Turbo | Yes      | No          | 16k            |\n\n### Anthropic\n\n| Model             | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :---------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Claude 4 Sonnet   | Yes      | Yes         | 200k           |\n| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Yes      | Yes         | 200k           |\n| Claude 3.5 Haiku  | Yes      | Yes         | 200k           |\n\n### Cohere\n\n| Model               | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :------------------ | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Command A           | Yes      | No          | 256k           |\n| Command A Reasoning | Yes      | No          | 256k           |\n| Command A Translate | Yes      | No          | 8k             |\n| Command A Vision    | No       | Yes         | 128k           |\n\n### Google\n\n| Model            | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :--------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Gemini 2.5 Pro   | Yes      | Yes         | 2M             |\n| Gemini 2.0 Flash | Yes      | Yes         | 1M             |\n\n### Mistral\n\n| Model           | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :-------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Devstral Medium | Yes      | No          | 32k            |\n| Mistral         | Yes      | No          | 32k            |\n\n### DeepSeek\n\n| Model             | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :---------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| DeepSeek V3       | Yes      | No          | 128k           |\n| DeepSeek Coder V2 | Yes      | No          | 128k           |\n| DeepSeek Chat     | Yes      | No          | 64k            |\n\n### xAI\n\n| Model                     | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :------------------------ | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Grok Code Fast 1          | Yes      | Yes         | 256k           |\n| Grok 4 Fast Reasoning     | Yes      | Yes         | 2M             |\n| Grok 4 Fast Non-Reasoning | Yes      | Yes         | 2M             |\n| Grok 4                    | Yes      | Yes         | 256k           |\n| Grok 3                    | Yes      | Yes         | 131k           |\n| Grok 3 Mini               | Yes      | Yes         | 131k           |\n\n### Moonshot AI\n\n| Model   | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :------ | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Kimi K2 | Yes      | Yes         | 128k           |\n\n### Qwen\n\n| Model             | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :---------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Qwen Coder 3 480B | Yes      | No          | 128k           |\n\n### Ollama (Local Models)\n\n| Model          | Tool Use | Image Input | Context Window |\n| :------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| Qwen 3 Coder   | Yes      | No          | 32k            |\n| Qwen 2.5 VL    | No       | Yes         | 128k           |\n| Devstral Small | Yes      | No          | 32k            |\n| Llama 3.1      | Yes      | No          | 128k           |\n| Llama 3        | Yes      | No          | 8k             |\n| Mistral        | Yes      | No          | 32k            |\n| Codestral      | Yes      | No          | 32k            |\n| Gemma 3 4B     | Yes      | Yes         | 128k           |\n\n### Notes\n\n- **Tool Use**: Function calling support (tools are required for Agent mode)\n- **Image Input**: Processing images\n- **Context Window**: Maximum number of tokens the model can process in a single request\n\n---\n\n**Is your model missing or incorrect?** Help improve this documentation!

The [Model Context\nProtocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) fixes this by\nletting AI models connect with outside data sources, tools, and environments.\nThis allows smooth sharing of information and abilities between AI systems and\nthe wider digital world. This standard, created by Anthropic to bring together\nprompts, context, and tool use, is key for building truly useful AI experiences\nthat can be set up with custom tools.\n\n## How MCP Works in Continue\n\nCurrently custom tools can be configured using the Model Context\nProtocol standard to unify prompts, context, and tool use.\n\nMCP Servers can be added to hub configs using `mcpServers`. You can\nexplore available MCP servers\n[here](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/mcp).\n\n<Info>MCP can only be used in the **agent** mode.</Info>\n\n## Quick Start: How to Set Up Your First MCP Server\n\nBelow is a quick example of setting up a new MCP server for use in your config:\n\n1. Create a folder called `.continue/mcpServers` at the top level of your workspace\n2. Add a file called `playwright-mcp.yaml` to this folder\n3. Write the following contents and save\n\n```yaml title=\".continue/mcpServers/playwright-mcp.yaml\"\nname: Playwright mcpServer\nversion: 0.0.1\nschema: v1\nmcpServers:\n  - name: Browser search\n    command: npx\n    args:\n      - \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"\n```\n\nNow test your MCP server by prompting the following command:\n\n```\nOpen the browser and navigate Hacker News. Save the top 10 headlines in a hn.txt file.\n```\n\nThe result will be a generated file called `hn.txt` in the current working directory.\n\n![playwright mcp](/images/mcp-playwright.png)\n\n## How to Set Up Continue Documentation Search with MCP\n\nYou can set up an MCP server to search the Continue documentation directly from your config. This is particularly useful for getting help with Continue configuration and features.\n\nFor complete setup instructions, troubleshooting, and usage examples, see the [Continue MCP Reference](/reference/continue-mcp).\n\n## Using JSON MCP Format from Claude, Cursor, Cline, etc\n\n<Info>\nIf you're coming from another tool that uses JSON MCP format configuration files (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Cline), you can copy those JSON config files directly into your `.continue/mcpServers/` directory (note the plural \"Servers\") and Continue will automatically pick them up.\n\nFor example, place your JSON MCP config file at `.continue/mcpServers/mcp.json` in your workspace.\n</Info>\n\n## How to Configure MCP Servers\n\nTo set up your own MCP server, read the [MCP\nquickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) and then [create an\n`mcpServers`](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=block&blockType=mcpServers) or add a local MCP\nserver block to your [config file](./configuration.md):\n\n```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n# ...\nmcpServers:\n  - name: SQLite MCP\n    command: npx\n    args:\n      - \"-y\"\n      - \"mcp-sqlite\"\n      - \"/path/to/your/database.db\"\n# ...\n```\n\n<Note>\nWhen creating a standalone block file in `.continue/mcpServers/`, remember to include the required metadata fields (`name`, `version`, `schema`) as shown in the Quick Start example above.\n</Note>\n\n### How to Configure MCP Server Properties\n\nMCP components include a few additional properties specific to MCP servers.\n\n- `name`: A display name for the MCP server.\n- `type`: The type of the MCP server: `sse`, `stdio`, `streamable-http`\n- `command`: The command to run to start the MCP server.\n- `args`: Arguments to pass to the command.\n- `env`: Secrets to be injected into the command as environment variables.\n\n### How to Choose MCP Transport Types\n\nMCP now supports remote server connections through HTTP-based transports, expanding beyond the traditional local stdio transport method. This enables integration with cloud-hosted MCP servers and distributed architectures.\n\n#### How to Use Server-Sent Events Transport (`sse`)\n\nFor real-time streaming communication, use the SSE transport:\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nmcpServers:\n  - name: Name\n    type: sse\n    url: https://....\n# ...\n```\n\n#### How to Use Standard Input/Output (`stdio`)\n\nFor local MCP servers that communicate via standard input and output:\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nmcpServers:\n  - name: Name\n    type: stdio\n    command: npx\n    args:\n      - \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite\"\n      - \"/path/to/your/database.db\"\n# ...\n```\n\n#### How to Use Streamable HTTP Transport\n\nFor standard HTTP-based communication with streaming capabilities:\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nmcpServers:\n  - name: Name\n    type: streamable-http\n    url: https://....\n# ...\n```\n\nThese remote transport options allow you to connect to MCP servers hosted on remote infrastructure, enabling more flexible deployment architectures and shared server resources across multiple clients.\n\nFor detailed information about transport mechanisms and their use cases, refer to the official MCP documentation on [transports](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse).\n\n### How to Work with Secrets in MCP Servers\n\nWith some MCP servers you will need to use API keys or other secrets. You can leverage locally stored environments secrets\nas well as access hosted secrets in the Continue Mission Control. To leverage Hub secrets, you can use the `inputs` property in your MCP env block instead of `secrets`.\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nmcpServers:\n  - name: Supabase MCP\n    command: npx\n    args:\n      - -y\n      - \"@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest\"\n      - --access-token\n      - ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_TOKEN }}\n    env:\n      SUPABASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_TOKEN }}\n  - name: GitHub\n    command: npx\n    args:\n      - \"-y\"\n      - \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-github\"\n    env:\n      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n# ...\n```\n"}

This is useful if you want to summarize what you've done or ask for a general review of your work before committing.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: diff\n```\n\n### `@Current File`\n\nReference the currently open file.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: currentFile\n```\n\n### `@Terminal`\n\nReference the last command you ran in your IDE's terminal and its output.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: terminal\n```\n\n### `@Open`\n\nReference the contents of all of your open files. Set `onlyPinned` to `true` to only reference pinned files.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: open\n    params:\n      onlyPinned: true\n```\n\n### `@Clipboard`\n\nReference recent clipboard items\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: clipboard\n```\n\n### `@Tree`\n\nReference the structure of your current workspace.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: tree\n```\n\n### `@Problems`\n\nGet Problems from the current file.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: problems\n```\n\n### `@Debugger`\n\nReference the contents of the local variables in the debugger. Currently only available in VS Code.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: debugger\n    params:\n      stackDepth: 3\n```\n\nUses the top _n_ levels (defaulting to 3) of the call stack for that thread.\n\n### `@Repository Map`\n\nReference the outline of your codebase. By default, signatures are included along with file in the repo map.\n\n`includeSignatures` params can be set to false to exclude signatures. This could be necessary for large codebases and/or to reduce context size significantly. Signatures will not be included if indexing is disabled.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: repo-map\n    params:\n      includeSignatures: false # default true\n```\n\nProvides a list of files and the call signatures of top-level classes, functions, and methods in those files. This helps the model better understand how a particular piece of code relates to the rest of the codebase.\n\nIn the submenu that appears, you can select either `Entire codebase`, or specify a subfolder to generate the repostiory map from.\n\nThis context provider is inpsired by [Aider's repository map](https://aider.chat/2023/10/22/repomap.html).\n\n### `@Operating System`\n\nReference the architecture and platform of your current operating system.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: os\n```\n\n### `@HTTP`\n\nThe HttpContextProvider makes a POST request to the url passed in the configuration. The server must return 200 OK with a ContextItem object or an array of ContextItems.\n\n```yaml config.yaml\ncontext:\n  - provider: http\n    params:\n      url: \"https://api.example.com/v1/users\"\n      headers:\n        - Authorization: \"Bearer <token>\"\n```\n\nThe receiving URL should expect to receive the following parameters:\n\nPOST parameters\n\n```json\n{  query: string,  fullInput: string}\n```\n\nThe response 200 OK should be a JSON object with the following structure:\n\nResponse\n\n```\n[  {    \"name\": \"\",    \"description\": \"\",    \"content\": \"\"  }]// OR{  \"name\": \"\",  \"description\": \"\",  \"content\": \"\"}\n```\n\n### Model Context Protocol\n\nThe [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standard proposed by Anthropic to unify prompts, context, and tool use. Continue supports any MCP server with the MCP context provider. Read their [quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart) to learn how to set up a local server and then set up your configuration like this:\n\n```yaml config.yaml\nmcpServers:\n  - name: My MCP Server\n    command: uvx\n    args:\n      - mcp-server-sqlite\n      - --db-path\n      - /Users/NAME/test.db\n```\n\nYou'll then be able to type \"@\" and see \"MCP\" in the context providers dropdown.\n\n## Deprecated Context Providers\n\n<Note>\n  To provide conext beyond the built-in context providers, we now recommend\n  using [MCP Servers](/customize/mcp-tools)\n</Note>\n\nView the [deprecated context providers](/reference/deprecated-context-providers) for documentation on:\n\n- [`@Codebase`](/reference/deprecated-codebase) - Use the [codebase awareness guide](/guides/codebase-documentation-awareness) instead\n- [`@Folder`](/reference/deprecated-codebase) - Use the [codebase awareness guide](/guides/codebase-documentation-awareness) instead\n- [`@Docs`](/reference/deprecated-docs) - Use the [documentation awareness guide](/guides/codebase-documentation-awareness) instead\n- `@Greptile` - Query Greptile index\n- `@Commits` - Reference git commits\n- `@Discord` - Reference Discord messages\n- `@Jira` - Reference Jira issues\n- `@Gitlab Merge Request` - Reference GitLab MRs\n- `@Google` - Google search results\n- `@Database` - Database schemas\n- `@Issue` - GitHub issues\n- `@Url` - URL content\n- `@Search` - Codebase search\n- `@Web` - Web search results\n"}

This includes the base chat system message ([see below](#how-to-customize-chat-system-message)).\n\n## Understanding Hub vs Local Rules Integration\n\n<Warning>\n**Important:** Rules created in different locations behave differently and have different synchronization patterns.\n</Warning>\n\nContinue supports two types of rules with different behaviors:\n\n<Columns cols={2}>\n<Card title=\"Local Rules\" icon=\"folder\">\n- **Location**: `.continue/rules` folder in your workspace\n- **Visibility**: Automatically visible when using Hub configs\n- **Creation**: Add rules button in VSCode or manual file creation\n- **File Management**: Creates actual `.md` files you can edit directly\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Hub Rules\" icon=\"cloud\">\n- **Location**: Stored on Continue Mission Control, referenced in config.yaml\n- **Visibility**: Only appear when referenced in assistant configuration\n- **Creation**: Created directly on Hub or copied from local rules\n- **File Management**: No local files created, managed through Hub interface\n</Card>\n</Columns>\n\n### How Rules Are Applied\n\nWhen using Continue, rules are loaded in this order:\n1. **Hub assistant rules** (if using a Hub-based assistant)\n2. **Referenced Hub rules** (via `uses:` in config.yaml)\n3. **Local workspace rules** (from `.continue/rules` folder)\n4. **Global rules** (from `~/.continue/rules` folder)\n\n<Info>\n**TL;DR**: Local rules show up automatically when using Hub configs. Hub rules show up automatically when referenced in your config.\n</Info>\n\n## Quick Start: How to Create Your First Rule File\n\nBelow is a quick example of setting up a new rule file:\n\n1. Create a folder called `.continue/rules` at the top level of your workspace\n2. Add a file called `pirates-rule.md` to this folder.\n3. Write the following contents to `pirates-rule.md` and save.\n\n```md title=\".continue/rules/pirates-rule.md\"\n---\nname: Pirate rule\n---\n\n- Talk like a pirate.\n```\n\nNow test your rules by asking a question about a file in chat.\n\n![pirate rule test](/images/pirate-rule-test.png)\n\n## How to Create Rules\n\n### Creating Local Rules\n\nRules can be added locally using the \"Add Rules\" button.\n\n![add local rules button](/images/add-local-rules.png)\n\n<Info>\n**Automatically create local rules**: When in Agent mode, you can prompt the agent to create a rule for you using the `create_rule_block` tool if enabled.\n\nFor example, you can say \"Create a rule for this\", and a rule will be created for you in `.continue/rules` based on your conversation.\n</Info>\n\n### Creating Hub Rules\n\nRules can also be created and managed on the Continue Mission Control:\n\n1. **Browse existing rules**: [Explore available rules](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=rules)\n2. **Create new rules**: [Create your own](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=block&blockType=rules) in the Hub\n3. **Copy from local rules**: Copy/paste content from your `.continue/rules` files to create Hub rules\n\n### Working Between Hub and Local Rules\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title=\"Hub to VSCode\">\nTo use Hub rules in your local setup:\n\n1. Reference them in your `config.yaml`:\n   ```yaml\n   rules:\n     - uses: username/my-hub-rule\n   ```\n2. The rule will automatically appear in your rules toolbar\n3. **Note**: No local file is created - the rule exists only on the Hub\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"VSCode to Hub\">\nTo move local rules to the Hub:\n\n1. Copy the content from your `.continue/rules/rule-name.md` file\n2. Go to [Create new rule](https://hub.continue.dev/new?type=block&blockType=rules)\n3. Paste the content and configure the rule\n4. Optionally, remove the local file and reference the Hub rule in your config\n\n<Warning>\n**Current Limitation**: There's no automatic sync from local to Hub. You must manually copy/paste rule content.\n</Warning>\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### How to Configure Rule Properties and Syntax\n\n<Info>\n  Rules were originally defined in YAML format (demonstrated below), but we\n  introduced Markdown for easier editing. While both are still supported, we\n  recommend Markdown.\n</Info>\n\nRules can be simple text, written in YAML configuration files, or as Markdown (`.md`) files. They can have the following properties:\n\n- `name` (**required** for YAML): A display name/title for the rule\n- `globs` (optional): When files are provided as context that match this glob pattern, the rule will be included. This can be either a single pattern (e.g., `\"**/*.{ts,tsx}\"`) or an array of patterns (e.g., `[\"src/**/*.ts\", \"tests/**/*.ts\"]`).\n- `regex` (optional): When files are provided as context and their content matches this regex pattern, the rule will be included. This can be either a single pattern (e.g., `\"^import .* from '.*';$\"`) or an array of patterns (e.g., `[\"^import .* from '.*';$\", \"^export .* from '.*';$\"]`).\n- `description` (optional): A description for the rule. Agents may read this description when `alwaysApply` is false to determine whether the rule should be pulled into context.\n- `alwaysApply`: Determines whether the rule is always included. Behavior is described below:\n  - `true`: Always included, regardless of file context\n  - `false`: Included if globs exist AND match file context, or the agent decides to pull the rule into context based on its description\n  - `undefined` (default behavior): Included if no globs exist OR globs exist and match\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title=\"Markdown\">\n```md title=\"doc-standards.md\"\n---\nname: Documentation Standards\nglobs: docs/**/*.{md,mdx}\nalwaysApply: false\ndescription: Standards for writing and maintaining Continue Docs\n---\n\n# Continue Docs Standards\n\n- Follow Mintlify documentation standards\n- Include YAML frontmatter with title, description, and keywords\n- Use consistent heading hierarchy starting with h2 (##)\n- Include relevant Admonition components for tips, warnings, and info\n- Use descriptive alt text for images\n- Include cross-references to related documentation\n- Reference other docs with relative paths\n- Keep paragraphs concise and scannable\n- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags\n\n````\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"YAML\">\n```yaml title=\"doc-standards.yaml\"\nname: Documentation Standards\nversion: 1.0.0\nschema: v1\n\nrules:\n  - name: Documentation Standards\n    globs: docs/**/*.{md,mdx}\n    alwaysApply: false\n    rule: >\n      - Follow Mintlify documentation standards\n      - Include YAML frontmatter with title, description, and keywords\n      - Use consistent heading hierarchy starting with h2 (##)\n      - Include relevant Admonition components for tips, warnings, and info\n      - Use descriptive alt text for images\n      - Include cross-references to related documentation\n      - Reference other docs with relative paths\n      - Keep paragraphs concise and scannable\n      - Use code blocks with appropriate language tags\n````\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### How to Set Up Project-Specific Rules\n\nYou can create project-specific rules by adding a `.continue/rules` folder to the root of your project and adding new rule files.\n\nRules files are loaded in lexicographical order, so you can prefix them with numbers to control the order in which they are applied. For example: `01-general.md`, `02-frontend.md`, `03-backend.md`.\n\n### Example: How to Create TypeScript-Specific Rules\n\n```md title=\".continue/rules/typescript.md\"\n---\nname: TypeScript Best Practices\nglobs: [\"**/*.ts\", \"**/*.tsx\"]\n---\n\n# TypeScript Rules\n\n- Always use TypeScript interfaces for object shapes\n- Use type aliases sparingly, prefer interfaces\n- Include proper JSDoc comments for public APIs\n- Use strict null checks\n- Prefer readonly arrays and properties where possible\n- modularize components into smaller, reusable pieces\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting Rules\n\n### Issue: Rules Created in Different Places Don't Sync\n\n**Problem**: You created rules in the Hub but don't see them in VSCode, or vice versa.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Hub rules** only appear when referenced in your config.yaml using the `uses:` syntax\n- **Local rules** automatically appear when using Hub configs\n- There's currently no automatic bidirectional sync\n\n### Issue: \"Edit\" Links Point to Wrong Location\n\n**Problem**: When you click \"Edit\" on a rule in VSCode, it tries to open the Hub even though the rule is local, or shows an incorrect URL.\n\n**Root Cause**: This happens when you have a mix of local and Hub rules, and Continue can't properly determine where each rule originates.\n\n**Workaround**:\n1. **For local rules**: Navigate directly to `.continue/rules/` folder and edit the `.md` file\n2. **For Hub rules**: Go directly to your assistant page on [Continue Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev) and edit from there\n3. Keep track of which rules are local vs Hub-based to avoid confusion\n\n<Info>\n**Known Issue**: This link accuracy problem is tracked in [Linear issue CON-3084](https://linear.app/continue/issue/CON-3084) and will be fixed in a future update.\n</Info>\n\n### Issue: Rules Don't Appear in Assistant\n\n**Problem**: Your rules exist but don't show up in the rules toolbar.\n\n**Check These**:\n1. **File location**: Ensure local rules are in `.continue/rules/` (not `.continue/rule/`)\n2. **File format**: Rules should be `.md` files with proper YAML frontmatter\n3. **Config reference**: Hub rules must be referenced in `config.yaml`\n4. **Assistant type**: Ensure you're using the correct assistant (local vs Hub)\n\n### How to Customize Chat System Message\n\nContinue includes a simple default system message for [Agent mode](../../ide-extensions/agent/quick-start) and [Chat](../../ide-extensions/chat/quick-start) requests, to help the model provide reliable codeblock formats in its output.\n\nThis can be viewed in the rules section of the toolbar (see above), or in the source code [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/llm/constructMessages.ts#L4).\n\nAdvanced users can override this system message for a specific model if needed by using `chatOptions.baseSystemMessage`. See the [`config.yaml` reference](/reference#models).\n"}

To do this, obtain an API key and add it to your config:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Hub\">\n  [Mistral Codestral model block](https://hub.continue.dev/mistral/codestral)\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  models:\n    - name: Codestral\n      provider: mistral\n      model: codestral-latest\n      apiKey: <YOUR_CODESTRAL_API_KEY>\n      roles:\n        - autocomplete\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"tabAutocompleteModel\": {\n      \"title\": \"Codestral\",\n      \"provider\": \"mistral\", \n      \"model\": \"codestral-latest\",\n      \"apiKey\": \"<YOUR_CODESTRAL_API_KEY>\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Tip>\n  **Codestral API Key**: The API keys for Codestral and the general Mistral APIs\n  are different. If you are using Codestral, you probably want a Codestral API\n  key, but if you are sharing the key as a team or otherwise want to use\n  `api.mistral.ai`, then make sure to set `\"apiBase\":\n  \"https://api.mistral.ai/v1\"` in your `tabAutocompleteModel`.\n</Tip>\n\n## How to Set Up Autocomplete in Continue with Ollama (Local Model)\n\nIf you'd like to run your autocomplete model locally, we recommend using Ollama. To do this, first download the latest version of Ollama from [here](https://ollama.ai). Then, run the following command to download our recommended model:\n\n```bash\nollama run qwen2.5-coder:1.5b\n```\n\nThen, add the model to your configuration:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Hub\">\n  [Ollama Qwen 2.5 Coder 1.5B model block](https://hub.continue.dev/ollama/qwen2.5-coder-1.5b)\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  models:\n    - name: Qwen 1.5b Autocomplete Model\n      provider: ollama\n      model: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b\n      roles:\n        - autocomplete\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"tabAutocompleteModel\": {\n      \"title\": \"Qwen 1.5b Autocomplete Model\",\n      \"provider\": \"ollama\", \n      \"model\": \"qwen2.5-coder:1.5b\",\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nOnce the model has been downloaded, you should begin to see completions in VS Code.\n\n<Note>\n  Typically, thinking-type models are not recommended as they generate more\n  slowly and are not suitable for scenarios that require speed.\n</Note>\n\nHowever, if you use any thinking-switchable models, you can configure these models for autocomplete functions by turning off the thinking mode.\n\nFor example:\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab title=\"YAML\">\n\n```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\nname: My Config\nversion: 0.0.1\nschema: v1\n\nmodels:\n  - name: Qwen3 without Thinking for Autocomplete\n    provider: ollama\n    model: qwen3:4b # qwen3 is a thinking-switchable model\n    roles:\n      - autocomplete\n    requestOptions:\n      extraBodyProperties:\n        think: false # turning off the thinking\n```\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nThen, in the continue panel, select this model as the default model for autocomplete.\n\n## Autocomplete Configuration Options in Continue\n\n### Autocomplete Models Available on the Continue Mission Control\n\nExplore autocomplete model configurations on [the hub](https://hub.continue.dev/explore/models?roles=autocomplete)\n\n### Customize Autocomplete User Settings in the Continue Extension\n\n{/* - `Use autocomplete cache`: If on, caches completions */}\nThe following settings can be configured for autocompletion in the IDE extension User Settings Page:\n\n- `Multiline Autocompletions`: Controls multiline completions for autocomplete. Can be set to `always`, `never`, or `auto`. Defaults to `auto`\n- `Disable autocomplete in files`: List of comma-separated glob pattern to disable autocomplete in matching files. E.g., \"\\_/.md, \\*/.txt\"\n\n### How to Configure Autocomplete with `config.json` (Deprecated Format)\n\n#### YAML Configuration\n\nThe `config.yaml` format offers model-level configuration using the `autocompleteOptions` field. See the [YAML Reference](/reference#models) for more details.\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: Codestral\n    provider: mistral\n    model: codestral-latest\n    roles:\n      - autocomplete\n    autocompleteOptions:\n      disable: false\n      maxPromptTokens: 1024\n      debounceDelay: 250\n      modelTimeout: 150\n      maxSuffixPercentage: 0.2\n      prefixPercentage: 0.3\n      onlyMyCode: true\n```\n\n#### JSON Configuration (Deprecated)\n\nThe `config.json` configuration format offers configuration options through `tabAutocompleteOptions`. See the [JSON Reference](/reference/json-reference#tabautocomplete-options) for more details.\n\n## Autocomplete FAQs and Troubleshooting in Continue\n\n### I want better completions, should I use GPT-5?\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, the answer is no. The models that we suggest for autocomplete are trained with a highly specific prompt format, which allows them to respond to requests for completing code (see examples of these prompts [here](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/autocomplete/templating/AutocompleteTemplate.ts)). Some of the best commercial models like GPT-5 or Claude are not trained with this prompt format, which means that they won't generate useful completions. Luckily, a huge model is not required for great autocomplete. Most of the state-of-the-art autocomplete models are no more than 10b parameters, and increasing beyond this does not significantly improve performance.\n\n### Autocomplete Not Working – How to Fix It\n\nFollow these steps to ensure that everything is set up correctly:\n\n1. Make sure you have the \"Enable Tab Autocomplete\" setting checked (in VS Code, you can toggle by clicking the \"Continue\" button in the status bar, and in JetBrains by going to Settings -> Tools -> Continue).\n2. Make sure you have downloaded Ollama.\n3. Run `ollama run qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` to verify that the model is downloaded.\n4. Make sure that any other completion providers are disabled (e.g. Copilot), as they may interfere.\n5. Check the output of the logs to find any potential errors: <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> -> \"Toggle Developer Tools\" -> \"Console\" tab in VS Code, ~/.continue/logs/core.log in JetBrains.\n6. Check VS Code settings to make sure that `\"editor.inlineSuggest.enabled\"` is set to `true` (use <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> then search for this and check the box)\n7. If you are still having issues, please let us know in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vapESyrFmJ) and we'll help as soon as possible.\n\n### Why Are My Completions Only Single-Line?\n\nTo ensure that you receive multi-line completions, you can set `\"multilineCompletions\": \"always\"` in `tabAutocompleteOptions`. By default, it is `\"auto\"`. If you still find that you are only seeing single-line completions, this may be because some models tend to produce shorter completions when starting in the middle of a file. You can try temporarily moving text below your cursor out of your active file, or switching to a larger model.\n\n### How to Set a Trigger Key for Autocomplete Suggestions\n\nIn VS Code, if you don't want to be shown suggestions automatically you can:\n\n1. Set `\"editor.inlineSuggest.enabled\": false` in VS Code settings to disable automatic suggestions\n2. Open \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" (cmd/ctrl+k, cmd/ctrl+s) and search for `editor.action.inlineSuggest.trigger`\n3. Click the \"+\" icon to add a new keybinding\n4. Press the key combination you want to use to trigger suggestions (e.g. <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd>)\n5. Now whenever you want to see a suggestion, you can press your key binding (e.g. <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd>) to trigger suggestions manually\n\n### Shortcut for Accepting One Line at a Time in Autocomplete\n\nThis is a built-in feature of VS Code, but it's just a bit hidden. Follow these settings to reassign the keyboard shortcuts in VS Code:\n\n1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>, type the command: `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts`, and enter the keyboard shortcuts settings page.\n2. Search for `editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine`.\n3. Set the key binding to <kbd>Tab</kbd>.\n4. Set the trigger condition (when) to `inlineSuggestionVisible && !editorReadonly`.\n   This will make multi-line completion (including continue and from VS Code built-in or other plugin snippets) still work, and you will see multi-line completion. However, Tab will only fill in one line at a time. Any unnecessary code can be canceled with <kbd>Esc</kbd>.\n   If you need to apply all the code, just press <kbd>Tab</kbd> multiple times.\n\n### How to Turn Off Autocomplete in Continue (VS Code and JetBrains)\n\n#### VS Code\n\nClick the \"Continue\" button in the status panel at the bottom right of the screen. The checkmark will become a \"cancel\" symbol and you will no longer see completions. You can click again to turn it back on.\n\nAlternatively, open VS Code settings, search for \"Continue\" and uncheck the box for \"Enable Tab Autocomplete\".\n\nYou can also use the default shortcut to disable autocomplete directly using a chord: press and hold <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (continue holding <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd>) and press <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>. This will turn off autocomplete without navigating through settings.\n\n#### JetBrains\n\nOpen Settings -> Tools -> Continue and uncheck the box for \"Enable Tab Autocomplete\".\n\n#### Feedback\n\nIf you're turning off autocomplete, we'd love to hear how we can improve! Please let us know in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vapESyrFmJ) or file an issue on GitHub.\n"}

Open the sidebar by pressing <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> (VS Code) or <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (JetBrains) and click the Agent selector above the main chat input. Then, you can hover over an agent and click the `new window` (hub agents) or `gear` (local agents) icon.\n\n![configure](/images/configure-continue.png)\n\n## How to Manage Hub Configs\n\n  Hub Configs can be managed in [the Hub](https://hub.continue.dev). See [Editing a config](/hub/configs/edit-a-config)\n\n## How to Configure Local Configs with YAML\n\nLocal user-level configuration is stored and can be edited in your home directory in `config.yaml`:\n\n- `~/.continue/config.yaml` (MacOS / Linux)\n- `%USERPROFILE%\\.continue\\config.yaml` (Windows)\n\nTo open this `config.yaml`, you need to open the configs dropdown in the top-right portion of the chat input. On that dropdown beside the \"Local Config\" option, select the cog icon. It will open the local `config.yaml`.\n\n![local-config-open-steps](/images/local-config-open-steps.png)\n\nWhen editing this file, you can see the available options suggested as you type, or check the reference below. When you save a config file from the IDE, Continue will automatically refresh to take into account your changes. A config file is automatically created the first time you use Continue, and always automatically generated with default values if it doesn't exist.\n\nSee the full reference for `config.yaml` [here](/reference).\n\n## Legacy Configuration Methods (Deprecated)\n\n<Info>\n  View the `config.json` migration guide [here](/reference/yaml-migration)\n</Info>\n\n- [`config.json`](/reference) - The original configuration format which is stored in a file at the same location as `config.yaml`\n- [`.continuerc.json`](#how-to-use-continuercjson-for-workspace-configuration) - Workspace-level configuration\n- [`config.ts`](#how-to-use-configts-for-advanced-configuration) - Advanced configuration (probably unnecessary) - a TypeScript file in your home directory that can be used to programmatically modify (_merged_) the `config.json` schema:\n  - `~/.continue/config.ts` (MacOS / Linux)\n  - `%USERPROFILE%\\.continue\\config.ts` (Windows)\n\n### How to Use `.continuerc.json` for Workspace Configuration\n\nThe format of `.continuerc.json` is the same as `config.json`, plus one _additional_ property `mergeBehavior`, which can be set to either \"merge\" or \"overwrite\". If set to \"merge\" (the default), `.continuerc.json` will be applied on top of `config.json` (arrays and objects are merged). If set to \"overwrite\", then every top-level property of `.continuerc.json` will overwrite that property from `config.json`.\n\nExample\n\n```json title=\".continuerc.json\"\n{\n  \"tabAutocompleteOptions\": {\n    \"disable\": true\n  },\n  \"mergeBehavior\": \"overwrite\"\n}\n```\n\n### How to Use `config.ts` for Advanced Configuration\n\n`config.yaml` or `config.json` can handle the vast majority of necessary configuration, so we recommend using it whenever possible. However, if you need to programmatically extend Continue configuration, you can use a `config.ts` file, placed at `~/.continue/config.ts` (MacOS / Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\\.continue\\config.ts` (Windows).\n\n`config.ts` must export a `modifyConfig` function, like:\n\n<Warning>\n  The `slashCommands` array shown below is deprecated.

Each agent includes:\n\n### Agent Components\n\n| **Component** | **Description** | **Example** |\n|----------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| **Prompt** | The agent’s main instruction that defines what it does and how it should behave. Additional user input is appended when invoked. | Example prompt: “Summarize ongoing work with status, blockers, and next steps. Use markdown formatting and a concise, professional tone.” |\n| **Rules** | Define consistent standards or behaviors that guide how the agent responds. Rules help ensure reliability across team usage. | “Always include related issue or PR links when summarizing work.” |\n| **Tools / MCPs** | External systems or integrations the agent can call to complete tasks. MCPs (Model Context Protocols) extend functionality through APIs. | GitHub, PostHog, Supabase |\n| **Model** | The large language model that powers the agent’s reasoning and output generation. | Claude Sonnet 4.5 |\n| **Visibility** | Determines who can view or use the agent.

Please refer to our [Guide on Making Agent Mode Aware of Codebases and Documentation](/guides/codebase-documentation-awareness) for the recommended approach.\n</Warning>\n\n## Migration Guide\n\nIf you're currently using `@Codebase` or `@Folder` context providers, please migrate to the new approach outlined in our [codebase and documentation awareness guide](/guides/codebase-documentation-awareness). The new approach provides:\n\n- Better integration with Continue's Agent mode features\n- More intelligent context selection\n- Improved performance and accuracy\n\n## Legacy Documentation\n\n*Below is the original documentation for the `@Codebase` context provider, preserved for reference*\n\nContinue indexes your codebase so that it can later automatically pull in the most relevant context from throughout your workspace. This is done via a combination of embeddings-based retrieval and keyword search. By default, all embeddings are calculated locally using `transformers.js` and stored locally in `~/.continue/index`.\n\n<Info>\n  **Note:** `transformers.js` cannot be used in JetBrains IDEs. However, you can\n  select a different embeddings model from [the list\n  here](../customize/model-roles/embeddings).\n</Info>\n\n## How to Use @Codebase and @Folder Context Providers\n\nCurrently, the codebase retrieval feature is available as the \"codebase\" and \"folder\" context providers. You can use them by typing `@Codebase` or `@Folder` in the input box, and then asking a question. The contents of the input box will be compared with the embeddings from the rest of the codebase (or folder) to determine relevant files.\n\n### When @Codebase Context Provider Is Useful\n\nHere are some common use cases where it can be useful:\n\n- **Asking high-level questions about your codebase**\n  - \"How do I add a new endpoint to the server?\"\n  - \"Do we use VS Code's CodeLens feature anywhere?\"\n  - \"Is there any code written already to convert HTML to markdown?\"\n- **Generate code using existing samples as reference**\n  - \"Generate a new React component with a date picker, using the same patterns as existing components\"\n  - \"Write a draft of a CLI application for this project using Python's argparse\"\n  - \"Implement the `foo` method in the `bar` class, following the patterns seen in other subclasses of `baz`.\n- **Use `@Folder` to ask questions about a specific folder, increasing the likelihood of relevant results**\n  - \"What is the main purpose of this folder?\"\n  - \"How do we use VS Code's CodeLens API?\"\n  - Or any of the above examples, but with `@Folder` instead of `@Codebase`\n\n### When @Codebase Context Provider Is Not Useful\n\nHere are use cases where it is not useful:\n\n- **When you need the LLM to see _literally every_ file in your codebase**\n  - \"Find everywhere where the `foo` function is called\"\n  - \"Review our codebase and find any spelling mistakes\"\n- **Refactoring tasks**\n  - \"Add a new parameter to the `bar` function and update usages\"\n\n## How to Configure @Codebase Context Provider Settings\n\nThere are a few options that let you configure the behavior of the `@codebase` context provider, which are the same for the `@folder` context provider:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\" \n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  context:\n    - provider: codebase\n      params:\n        nRetrieve: 25\n        nFinal: 5\n        useReranking: true\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"contextProviders\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"codebase\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"nRetrieve\": 25,\n          \"nFinal\": 5,\n          \"useReranking\": true\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### `nRetrieve`\n\nNumber of results to initially retrieve from vector database (default: 25)\n\n### `nFinal`\n\nFinal number of results to use after re-ranking (default: 5)\n\n### `useReranking`\n\nWhether to use re-ranking, which will allow initial selection of `nRetrieve` results, then will use an LLM to select the top `nFinal` results (default: true)\n\n## How to Ignore Files During Indexing\n\nContinue respects `.gitignore` files in order to determine which files should not be indexed. If you'd like to exclude additional files, you can add them to a `.continueignore` file, which follows the exact same rules as `.gitignore`.\n\nContinue also supports a **global** `.continueignore` file that will be respected for all workspaces, which can be created at `~/.continue/.continueignore`.\n\nIf you want to see exactly what files Continue has indexed, the metadata is stored in `~/.continue/index/index.sqlite`. You can use a tool like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to view the `tag_catalog` table within this file.\n\nIf you need to force a refresh of the index, reload the VS Code window with <kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> + \"Reload Window\"."}

YAML is the preferred format and will be used to integrate with future Continue products. Below is a brief guide for migration from config.json to config.yaml.\"\n---\n\nSee also\n\n- [Intro to YAML](https://yaml.org/)\n- [YAML Continue Config Reference](/reference)\n\n## Create YAML file\n\nCreate a `config.yaml` file in your Continue Global Directory (`~/.continue` on Mac, `%USERPROFILE%\\.continue`) alongside your current config.json file. If a `config.yaml` file is present, it will be loaded instead of config.json.\n\nGive your configuration a `name` and a `version`:\n\nconfig.yaml\n\n```\nname: my-configurationversion: 0.0.1schema: v1\n```\n\n### Models\n\nAdd all model configurations in `config.json`, including models in `models`, `tabAutocompleteModel`, `embeddingsProvider`, and `reranker`, to the `models` section of your new YAML config file. A new `roles` YAML field specifies which roles a model can be used for, with possible values `chat`, `autocomplete`, `embed`, `rerank`, `edit`, `apply`, `summarize`.\n\n- `models` in config should have `roles: [chat]`\n\n- `tabAutocompleteModel`(s) in config should have `roles: [autocomplete]`\n\n- `embeddingsProvider` in config should have `roles: [embed]`\n\n- `reranker` in config should have `roles: [rerank]`\n\n- `experimental.modelRoles` is replaced by simply adding roles to the model\n  - `inlineEdit` -> e.g. `roles: [chat, edit]`\n  - `applyCodeBlock` -> e.g. `roles: [chat, apply]`\n\nModel-level `requestOptions` remain, with minor changes.

Top-level `completionOptions` apply to all models, _unless overridden at the model level_.\n\n**Properties:**\n\n- `stream`: Whether to stream the LLM response. Currently only respected by the `anthropic` and `ollama` providers; other providers will always stream (default: `true`).\n- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the completion. Higher values result in more diverse outputs.\n- `topP`: The cumulative probability for nucleus sampling. Lower values limit responses to tokens within the top probability mass.\n- `topK`: The maximum number of tokens considered at each step. Limits the generated text to tokens within this probability.\n- `presencePenalty`: Discourages the model from generating tokens that have already appeared in the output.\n- `frequencyPenalty`: Penalizes tokens based on their frequency in the text, reducing repetition.\n- `mirostat`: Enables Mirostat sampling, which controls the perplexity during text generation. Supported by Ollama, LM Studio, and llama.cpp providers (default: `0`, where `0` = disabled, `1` = Mirostat, and `2` = Mirostat 2.0).\n- `stop`: An array of stop tokens that, when encountered, will terminate the completion. Allows specifying multiple end conditions.\n- `maxTokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate in a completion (default: `2048`).\n- `numThreads`: The number of threads used during the generation process. Available only for Ollama as `num_thread`.\n- `keepAlive`: For Ollama, this parameter sets the number of seconds to keep the model loaded after the last request, unloading it from memory if inactive (default: `1800` seconds, or 30 minutes).\n- `numGpu`: For Ollama, this parameter overrides the number of gpu layers that will be used to load the model into VRAM.\n- `useMmap`: For Ollama, this parameter allows the model to be mapped into memory. If disabled can enhance response time on low end devices but will slow down the stream.\n- `reasoning`: Enables thinking/reasoning for Anthropic Claude 3.7+ and some Ollama models.\n- `reasoningBudgetTokens`: Sets budget tokens for thinking/reasoning in Anthropic Claude 3.7+ models.\n\nExample\n\nconfig.json\n\n```json\n{ \"completionOptions\": { \"stream\": false, \"temperature\": 0.5 } }\n```\n\n## `requestOptions`\n\nDefault HTTP request options that apply to all models and context providers, unless overridden at the model level.\n\n**Properties:**\n\n- `timeout`: Timeout for each request to the LLM (default: 7200 seconds).\n\n- `verifySsl`: Whether to verify SSL certificates for requests.\n\n- `caBundlePath`: Path to a custom CA bundle for HTTP requests - path to `.pem` file (or array of paths)\n\n- `proxy`: Proxy URL to use for HTTP requests.\n\n- `headers`: Custom headers for HTTP requests.\n\n- `extraBodyProperties`: Additional properties to merge with the HTTP request body.\n\n- `noProxy`: List of hostnames that should bypass the specified proxy.\n\n- `clientCertificate`: Client certificate for HTTP requests.\n  - `cert`: Path to the client certificate file.\n  - `key`: Path to the client certificate key file.\n  - `passphrase`: Optional passphrase for the client certificate key file.\n\nExample\n\nconfig.json\n\n```json\n{ \"requestOptions\": { \"headers\": { \"X-Auth-Token\": \"xxx\" } } }\n```\n\n### `reranker`\n\nConfiguration for the reranker model used in response ranking.\n\n**Properties:**\n\n- `name` (**required**): Reranker name, e.g., `cohere`, `voyage`, `llm`, `huggingface-tei`, `bedrock`\n\n- `params`:\n  - `model`: Model name\n  - `apiKey`: Api key\n  - `region`: Region (for Bedrock only)\n\nExample\n\nconfig.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reranker\": {\n    \"name\": \"voyage\",\n    \"params\": { \"model\": \"rerank-2\", \"apiKey\": \"<VOYAGE_API_KEY>\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## `docs`\n\nList of documentation sites to index.\n\n**Properties:**\n\n- `title` (**required**): Title of the documentation site, displayed in dropdowns, etc.\n- `startUrl` (**required**): Start page for crawling - usually root or intro page for docs\n\n- `maxDepth`: Maximum link depth for crawling. Default `4`\n- `favicon`: URL for site favicon (default is `/favicon.ico` from `startUrl`).\n- `useLocalCrawling`: Skip the default crawler and only crawl using a local crawler.\n\nExample\n\nconfig.json\n\n```\n\"docs\": [    {    \"title\": \"Continue\",    \"startUrl\": \"https://docs.continue.dev/intro\",    \"faviconUrl\": \"https://docs.continue.dev/favicon.ico\",  }]\n```\n\n## `slashCommands`\n\nCustom commands initiated by typing \"/\" in the sidebar.

Embedding chat input to include similar documentation chunks as context\n\n## How to Index Your Own Documentation\n\n**Note:** Documentation configuration should now be done directly in your `config.yaml` file. The previous `docs` blocks functionality has been deprecated.\n\n### How to Add Documentation Through the @Docs Context Provider\n\nTo add a single documentation site, we recommend using the **Add Documentation** Form within the GUI. This can be accessed\n\n- from the `@Docs` context provider - type `@Docs` in the chat, hit `Enter`, and search for `Add Docs`\n- from the `More` page (three dots icon) in the `@docs indexes` section\n  the `@Docs` context provider.\n\nIn the **Add Documentation** Form, enter a `Title` and `Start URL` for the site.\n\n- `Title`: The name of the documentation site, used for identification in the UI.\n- `Start URL`: The URL where the indexing process should begin.\n\nIndexing will begin upon submission. Progress can be viewed in the form or later in the `@docs indexes` section of the `More` page.\n\nDocumentation sources may be suggested based on package files in your repo. This currently works for Python `requirements.txt` files and Node.js (Javascript/Typescript) `package.json` files.\n\n- Packages with a valid documentation URL (with a `+` icon) can be clicked to immediately kick off indexing\n- Packages with partial information (with a pen icon) can be clicked to fill the form with the available information\n- Note that you can hover over the information icon to see where the package suggestion was found.\n\n![Add documentation form](/images/docs-form.png)\n\n### How to Add Documentation in Configuration Files\n\nFor bulk documentation site adds or edits, we recommend editing your global configuration file directly. Documentation sites are stored in an array within `docs` in your global configuration, as follows:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  docs:\n    - title: Nest.js\n      startUrl: https://docs.nestjs.com/\n      faviconUrl: https://docs.nestjs.com/favicon.ico\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"docs\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Nest.js\",\n        \"startUrl\": \"https://docs.nestjs.com/\",\n        \"faviconUrl\": \"https://docs.nestjs.com/favicon.ico\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nSee [the config reference](/reference) for all documentation site configuration options.\n\nIndexing will re-sync upon saving the configuration file.\n\n## How to Configure @Docs Advanced Settings\n\n### How to Use Your Custom Embeddings Provider\n\nIf you have set up an [embeddings provider](../customize/model-roles/embeddings.mdx), @docs will use your embeddings provider. Switching embeddings providers will trigger a re-index of all documentation sites in your configuration.\n\n### How to Configure Reranking for Better Results\n\nAs with [@Codebase context provider configuration](./deprecated-codebase#configuration), you can adjust the reranking behavior of the `@Docs` context provider with the `nRetrieve`, `nFinal`, and `useReranking`.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  context:\n    - provider: docs\n      params:\n        nRetrieve: 25 # The number of docs to retrieve from the embeddings query\n        nFinal: 5 # The number of docs chunks to return IF reranking\n        useReranking: true # use reranking if a reranker is configured (defaults to true)\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"contextProviders\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"docs\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"nRetrieve\": 25, // The number of docs to retrieve from the embeddings query\n          \"nFinal\": 5, // The number of docs chunks to return IF reranking\n          \"useReranking\": true // use reranking if a reranker is configured (defaults to true)\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### How to Set Up GitHub Token for GitHub Documentation\n\nThe GitHub API rate limits public requests to 60 per hour. If you want to reliably index GitHub repos, you can add a github token to your config file:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  context:\n    - provider: docs\n      params:\n        githubToken: <GITHUB_TOKEN>\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"contextProviders\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"docs\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"githubToken\": \"github_...\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### How to Enable Local Crawling for Private Documentation\n\nBy default, Continue crawls documentation sites using a specialized crawling service that provides the best experience for most users and documentation sites.\n\nIf your documentation is private, you can skip the default crawler and use a local crawler instead by setting `useLocalCrawling` to `true`.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  docs:\n    - title: My Private Docs\n      startUrl: http://10.2.1.2/docs\n      faviconUrl: http://10.2.1.2/docs/assets/favicon.ico,\n      useLocalCrawling: true\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"docs\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"My Private Docs\",\n        \"startUrl\": \"http://10.2.1.2/docs\",\n        \"faviconUrl\": \"http://10.2.1.2/docs/assets/favicon.ico\",\n        \"useLocalCrawling\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Info>\n  The default local crawler is a lightweight tool that cannot render sites that\n  are dynamically generated using JavaScript. If your sites need to be rendered,\n  you can enable the experimental `Use Chromium for Docs Crawling` feature from\n  your User Settings Page. This will download and install Chromium\n  to `~/.continue/.utils`, and use it as the local crawler. **Note:** Chromium\n  crawling support is being deprecated and may be removed in future versions.\n</Info>\n\nFurther notes:\n\n- If the site is only locally accessible, the default crawler will fail anyways and fall back to the local crawler. `useLocalCrawling` is especially useful if the URL itself is confidential.\n- For GitHub Repos this has no effect because only the GitHub Crawler will be used, and if the repo is private it can only be accessed with a priveleged GitHub token anyways.\n\n## How to Manage Your Documentation Indexes\n\nYou can view indexing statuses and manage your documentation sites from the `@docs indexes` section of the `More` page (three dots)\n\n- Continue does not automatically re-index your docs. Use `Click to re-index` to trigger a reindex for a specific source\n- While a site is indexing, click `Cancel indexing` to cancel the process\n- Failed indexing attempts will show an error status bar and icon\n- Delete a documentation site from your configuration using the trash icon\n\n![More Page @docs indexes section](/images/docs-indexes.png)\n\nYou can also view the overall status of currently indexing docs from a hideable progress bar at the bottom of the chat page\n\n![Documentation indexing peek](/images/docs-indexing-peek.png)\n\nYou can also use the following IDE command to force a re-index of all docs: `Continue: Docs Force Re-Index`.\n\n## Configuration Examples for Different Setups\n\n### How to Set Up @Docs in VS Code (Minimal Configuration)\n\nThe following configuration example works out of the box for VS Code. This uses the built-in embeddings provider with no reranking.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  context:\n    - provider: docs\n    \n  docs:\n    - title: Nest.js\n      startUrl: https://docs.nestjs.com/\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"contextProviders\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"docs\",\n      }\n    ],\n    \"docs\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Nest.js\",\n        \"startUrl\": \"https://docs.nestjs.com/\",\n      },\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### How to Set Up @Docs in JetBrains IDEs (Minimal Configuration)\n\nHere is the equivalent minimal example for Jetbrains, which requires setting up an [embeddings provider](../customize/model-roles/embeddings.mdx).\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  models:\n    - name: LMStudio embedder\n      provider: lmstudio\n      model: nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF\n      roles:\n        - embed\n  context:\n    - provider: docs\n  docs:\n    - title: Nest.js\n      startUrl: https://docs.nestjs.com/\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"contextProviders\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"docs\",\n      }\n    ],\n    \"docs\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Nest.js\",\n        \"startUrl\": \"https://docs.nestjs.com/\",\n      },\n    ],\n    \"embeddingsProvider\": {\n      \"provider\": \"lmstudio\",\n      \"model\": \"nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### How to Set Up @Docs with Advanced Features (VS Code or JetBrains)\n\nThe following configuration example includes:\n\n- Examples of both public and private documentation sources\n- A custom embeddings provider\n- A reranker model available, with reranking parameters customized\n- A GitHub token to enable GitHub crawling\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"YAML\">\n  ```yaml title=\"config.yaml\"\n  name: My Config\n  version: 0.0.1\n  schema: v1\n\n  models:\n    - name: LMStudio Nomic Text\n      provider: lmstudio\n      model: nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF\n      roles:\n        - embed\n    - name: Voyage Rerank-2\n      provider: voyage\n      apiKey: <VOYAGE_API_KEY>\n      model: rerank-2\n      roles:\n        - rerank\n  context:\n    - provider: docs\n      params:\n         githubToken: <GITHUB_TOKEN>\n         nRetrieve: 25\n         nFinal: 5\n         useReranking: true\n  docs:\n    - title: Nest.js\n      startUrl: https://docs.nestjs.com/\n    - title: My Private Docs\n      startUrl: http://10.2.1.2/docs\n      faviconUrl: http://10.2.1.2/docs/assets/favicon.ico\n      useLocalCrawling: true\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n  <Tab title=\"JSON\">\n  ```json title=\"config.json\"\n  {\n    \"contextProviders\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"docs\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"githubToken\": \"github_...\",\n          \"nRetrieve\": 25,\n          \"nFinal\": 5,\n          \"useReranking\": true\n        }\n      }\n    ],\n    \"docs\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Nest.js\",\n        \"startUrl\": \"https://docs.nestjs.com/\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"title\": \"My Private Docs\",\n        \"startUrl\": \"http://10.2.1.2/docs\",\n        \"faviconUrl\": \"http://10.2.1.2/docs/assets/favicon.ico\",\n        \"maxDepth\": 4,\n        \"useLocalCrawling\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"reranker\": {\n      \"name\": \"voyage\",\n      \"params\": {\n        \"model\": \"rerank-2\",\n        \"apiKey\": \"<YOUR_VOYAGE_API_KEY>\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"embeddingsProvider\": {\n      \"provider\": \"lmstudio\",\n      \"model\": \"nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nThis setup could also involve enabling Chromium as a backup for local documentation through the User Settings Page (Gear Icon)."}

Ask it to help you create or edit documentation\n        \n        Example prompts:\n        - \"Help me format this documentation according to Mintlify standards\"\n        - \"Create a troubleshooting section for this feature\"\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n## 📝 Documentation Standards\n\n### Mintlify Component Guidelines\n\nWhen using Mintlify components, follow these formatting rules:\n\n#### Cards and Info Boxes\n\n```mdx\n<Card title=\"Best Practice\" icon=\"lightbulb\">\n\nAlways include blank lines and proper indentation:\n\n- Use 2-space indentation\n- Add blank lines after opening tags\n- Format lists as bullet points\n\n</Card>\n```\n\n#### Warning and Note Components\n\n```mdx\n<Warning>\n\nImportant information should be formatted clearly:\n\n- Each point on its own line\n- Consistent indentation\n- Clear, concise language\n\n</Warning>\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\n1. **Be concise**: Get to the point quickly\n2. **Use examples**: Show, don't just tell\n3. **Include code blocks**: Provide working examples\n4. **Add visuals**: Screenshots and diagrams help understanding\n5. **Test your changes**: Ensure all links and code examples work\n\n<Warning>\nIf you are creating a new guide, please test the steps yourself to ensure accuracy.\n</Warning>\n\n## 🔧 Common Tasks\n\n### Adding a New Guide\n\n1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the guides directory\n2. Add frontmatter:\n   ```mdx\n   ---\n   title: \"Your Guide Title\"\n   description: \"Brief description of what this guide covers\"\n   ---\n   ```\n3. Use the Continue agent to help format your content\n4. Update `docs.json` to include your new page in the navigation\n\n<Tip>\nWe have both guides and cookbooks. Use guides for step-by-step instructions and cookbooks for creating agents for the CLI.\n</Tip>\n\n### Updating Existing Documentation\n\n1. Use the Continue agent with prompts like:\n   - \"Update the installation guide with the new npm package\"\n   - \"Add a troubleshooting section for connection issues\"\n2. The agent will maintain consistent formatting automatically\n\n### Adding Code Examples\n\nUse language-specific code blocks:\n\n````mdx\n```typescript\n// Your TypeScript code here\nconst example = \"Hello, Continue!\";\n```\n````\n\n## 🐛 Testing Your Changes\n\n1. **Local preview**: In the docs directory, run `npm run dev` and check your changes\n2. **Link validation**: Ensure all internal and external links work\n3. **Format check**: Use the Continue agent to validate Mintlify formatting\n4. **Build test**: Run `npm run build` to ensure no build errors\n\n## 📤 Submitting Your Contribution\n\n1. **Create a feature branch**\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b docs/your-feature-name\n   ```\n\n2. **Commit your changes**\n\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"docs: describe your changes\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Push and create a Pull Request**\n\n   ```bash\n   # Push to your fork and create a PR\n   git push origin docs/your-feature-name\n   gh pr create --web\n   ```\n\n<Tip>\n\n  The `gh pr create` command will automatically:\n  - Push your branch to your fork\n  - Create a pull request to the main repository\n  - Allow you to add a title, description, and reference issues\n  - Open the PR in your browser if using `--web`\n\n</Tip>\n\n### Linking Your PR to Issues\n\n<Info>\n\n**Important**: When your PR addresses a specific issue, make sure to link it using GitHub keywords.\n\n</Info>\n\nTo automatically link your PR to an issue and close it when the PR is merged, use one of these keywords in your PR description:\n\n- `closes #issue_number`\n- `fixes #issue_number`\n- `resolves #issue_number`\n\n**Example PR description:**\n```markdown\nImproved the installation guide with clearer steps for Windows users.\n\nCloses #1234\n```\n\nThis helps us track which issues are being worked on and automatically closes them when your PR is merged.\n\n<Tip>\n\nLearn more about linking PRs to issues in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests).\n\n</Tip>\n\n## 💡 Tips for Success\n\n- **Use the Continue agent**: It knows our documentation standards and will save you time\n- **Preview frequently**: Check your changes in the local dev server\n- **Ask questions**: Open an issue or discussion if you need clarification\n- **Small PRs are better**: Focus on one topic or fix per PR\n- **Update examples**: Ensure code examples reflect the latest API\n\n\n## 🆘 Getting Help\n\n- **Start a Discussion**: Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/discussions) for documentation issues, suggestions, or questions\n- **Continue agent questions**: Check the [Continue Mission Control page](https://hub.continue.dev/continuedev/docs-mintlify)\n- **Discord community**: Join our Discord for real-time help\n- **Existing docs**: Review similar pages for formatting examples\n---\n\nThank you for contributing to Continue!

The mode selector offers three options:\n\n- **Chat mode**: No tools available, pure conversation\n- **Plan mode**: Read-only tools for safe exploration and planning\n- **Agent mode**: All tools available for making changes\n\n![How to select agent mode](/images/mode-select-agent.png)\n\n<Info>\n  If Agent mode or Plan mode is disabled with a `Not Supported` message, the selected\n  model or provider doesn't support tools, or Continue doesn't yet support tools\n  with it. See [Model Blocks](/customize/models) for more information.\n</Info>\n\n<Tip>\n  Use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl + .` to quickly cycle between modes.\n</Tip>\n\n### How to Chat with Agent mode\n\nAgent mode lives within the same interface as [Chat](/ide-extensions/chat/how-it-works) mode, so the same [input](/ide-extensions/chat/quick-start#how-to-start-a-conversation) is used to send messages and you can still use the same manual methods of providing context, such as [`@` context providers](/ide-extensions/chat/quick-start#how-to-use--for-additional-context) or adding [highlighted code from the editor](/ide-extensions/chat/quick-start#how-to-include-code-context).\n\n#### How to Use Natural Language with Agent mode\n\nWith Agent mode, you can provide natural language instruction and let the model do the work. As an example, you might say\n\n> Set the @typescript-eslint/naming-convention rule to \"off\" for all eslint configurations in this project\n\nAgent mode will then decide which tools to use to get the job done.\n\n## How to Give Agent Mode Permission\n\nBy default, Agent mode will ask permission when it wants to use a tool. Click `Continue` to allow Agent mode to proceed with the tool call or `Cancel` to reject it.\n\n![agent requesting permission](/images/ide-extensions/agent/images/agent-permission-c150919a5c43eb4f55d9d4a46ef8b2d6.png)\n\nYou can use tool policies to exclude or make usage automatic for specific tools. See [MCP Tools](/customize/mcp-tools) for more background.\n\n## How to View Tool Responses\n\nAny data returned from a tool call is automatically fed back into the model as a context item. Most errors are also caught and returned, so that Agent mode can decide how to proceed.\n\n![agent response](/images/ide-extensions/agent/images/agent-response-c7287c82aac93fb4376f9d85b352b2d7.png)\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"docs/ide-extensions/agent/model-setup.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"Model Setup for Agent Mode\"\ndescription: \"Learn how to set up models for Agent Mode in Continue, including recommended models and configuration options for optimal performance\"\nsidebarTitle: \"Model Setup\"\n---\nimport { ModelRecommendations } from '/snippets/ModelRecommendations.jsx'\n\nThe models you set up for Chat mode will be used with Agent mode if the model supports tool calling. The recommended models and how to set them up can be found [here](/ide-extensions/chat/model-setup).\n\n## How System Message Tools Work\n\nContinue implements an innovative approach called **system message tools** that ensures consistent tool functionality across all models, regardless of their native capabilities. This allows Agent mode to work seamlessly with a wider range of models and providers.\n\n### How System Message Tools Function\n\nInstead of relying solely on native tool calling APIs (which vary between providers), Continue converts tools into XML format and includes them in the system message. The model generates tool calls as structured XML within its response, which Continue then parses and executes. This approach provides:\n\n- **Universal compatibility** - Any model capable of following instructions can use tools, not just those with native tool support\n- **Consistent behavior** - Tool calls work identically across OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, and others\n- **Better reliability** - Models that struggle with native tools often perform better with system message tools\n- **Seamless switching** - Change between providers without modifying your workflow\n\n## Recommended Agent Models\n\n<ModelRecommendations role=\"all\" />\n\n### How to Configure Agent Mode\n\nAgent mode automatically determines whether to use native or system message tools based on the model's capabilities. No additional configuration is required - simply select your model and Continue handles the rest.\n\n## How to Check Model Compatibility\n\nTo see which models support specific features like tool use (for Agent mode) and image input, check out our [Model Capabilities guide](/customize/deep-dives/model-capabilities)."}

It's designed for safe exploration, understanding code, and planning changes without making any modifications.\n\n![Plan mode in action](/images/plan-mode.gif)\n\n### What Are the Key Features of Plan Mode?\n\n- **Read-only tools**: Access files, search, and analyze without risk\n- **Safe exploration**: Perfect for understanding unfamiliar codebases\n- **Planning focus**: Develop implementation strategies before execution\n- **MCP support**: Works with all MCP tools alongside built-in read-only tools\n\n### How Plan Mode Works\n\nPlan mode filters the available tools to only include read-only operations. This means you can:\n\n- Read any file in your project\n- Search through code with grep and glob patterns\n- View repository structure and diffs\n- Fetch web content for additional context\n- Use all MCP tools\n\nBut you cannot:\n\n- Create, edit, or delete files\n- Run terminal commands\n- Make any system changes\n\n### How to Get Started with Plan Mode\n\nSelect \"Plan\" from the mode selector below the chat input, or use `Cmd/Ctrl + .` to cycle through modes.\n\n![Plan mode selector](/images/plan-mode-selector.png)\n\nFor detailed information about tools and usage, see the [Agent documentation](/ide-extensions/agent/how-it-works), which covers both Agent and Plan modes.\n\n### What Is the Common Workflow for Plan Mode?\n\n1. **Start in Plan mode** to explore and understand\n2. **Develop your approach** with the model's help\n3. **Switch to Agent mode** when ready to implement\n\n<Tip>\n  Plan mode shares the same interface and context features as Chat and Agent\n  modes.

Explore [MCP Servers on Mission Control](https://hub.continue.dev/hub?type=mcpServers) and consult the [MCP guide](/customize/deep-dives/mcp) for more details.\n\n## How to Configure Tool Policies\n\nYou can adjust the Agent mode's tool usage behavior to three options:\n\n- **Ask First (default)**: Request user permission with \"Cancel\" and \"Continue\" buttons\n- **Automatic**: Automatically call the tool without requesting permission\n- **Excluded**: Do not send the tool to the model\n\n:::warning\nBe careful setting tools to \"automatic\" if their behavior is not read-only.\n:::\n\nTo manage tool policies:\n\n1. Click the tools icon in the input toolbar\n2. View and change policies by clicking on the policy text\n3. You can also toggle groups of tools on/off\n\nTool policies are stored locally per user.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"docs/ide-extensions/agent/how-it-works.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"How Agent Mode Works\"\ndescription: \"Agent mode offers the same functionality as Chat mode, while also including tools in the request to the model and an interface for handling tool calls and responses.\"\n---\n\n## How the Tool Handshake Works\n\nTools provide a flexible, powerful way for models to interface with the external world. They are provided to the model as a JSON object with a name and an arguments schema. For example, a `read_file` tool with a `filepath` argument will give the model the ability to request the contents of a specific file.\n\nThe following handshake describes how Agent mode uses tools:\n\n1. In Agent mode, available tools are sent along with `user` chat requests\n2. The model can choose to include a tool call in its response\n3. The user gives permission. This step is skipped if the policy for that tool is set to `Automatic`\n4. Continue calls the tool using built-in functionality or the MCP server that offers that particular tool\n5. Continue sends the result back to the model\n6. The model responds, potentially with another tool call and step 2 begins again\n\n<Info>\n  Tool availability varies by mode: - **Chat mode**: No tools included - **Plan\n  mode**: Only read-only tools included - **Agent mode**: All tools included\n</Info>\n\n## What Built-in Tools Are Available\n\nContinue includes several built-in tools which provide the model access to IDE functionality.\n\n### What Tools Are Available in Plan Mode (Read-Only)\n\nIn Plan mode, only these read-only tools are available:\n\n- **Read file** (`read_file`)\n- **Read currently open file** (`read_currently_open_file`)\n- **List directory** (`ls`)\n- **Glob search** (`glob_search`)\n- **Grep search** (`grep_search`)\n- **Fetch URL content** (`fetch_url_content`)\n- **Search web** (`search_web`)\n- **View diff** (`view_diff`)\n- **View repo map** (`view_repo_map`)\n- **View subdirectory** (`view_subdirectory`)\n- **Codebase tool** (`codebase_tool`)\n\n### What Tools Are Available in Agent Mode (All Tools)\n\nIn Agent mode, all tools are available including the read-only tools above plus:\n\n- **Create new file** (`create_new_file`): Create a new file within the project\n- **Edit file** (`edit_existing_file`): Make changes to existing files\n- **Run terminal command** (`run_terminal_command`): Run commands from the workspace root\n- **Create Rule Block** (`create_rule_block`): Create a new rule block in `.continue/rules`\n- All other write/execute tools for modifying the codebase\n"}

It equips the Chat model with read-only tools, allowing you to explore, analyze, and plan modifications before executing them.\n\n### Use Plan\n\nYou can switch to `Plan` in the mode selector below the chat input box.\n\n![How to select plan mode](/images/plan-mode-selector.png)\n\n<Info>\n  If Plan is disabled with a `Not Supported` message, the selected model or\n  provider doesn't support tools.

The conversation context carries over, so Agent mode can immediately start implementing the plan you developed.\n\n<Tip>\n  Use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl + .` to quickly cycle between Agent, Chat,\n  and Plan modes.\n</Tip>\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"docs/ide-extensions/plan/how-it-works.mdx","content":"---\ntitle: \"How Plan Works\"\ndescription: \"Plan mode provides a restricted environment with read-only tools, enabling safe exploration and planning without making changes to your codebase.\"\n---\n\n## Understanding Plan mode\n\nPlan mode is designed to help you understand code and construct plans before making changes. It sits between Chat mode (no tools) and Agent mode (all tools), providing a middle ground where you can explore and analyze without risk.\n\n### The key difference: Read-only tools\n\nWhile Agent mode has access to all tools including those that modify files, Plan mode restricts access to only read-only tools. This ensures that:\n\n- No files are created, modified, or deleted\n- No commands are executed that could change system state\n- All exploration is safe and non-destructive\n- You can confidently investigate without unintended consequences\n\n## How Plan mode works\n\nWhen you select Plan mode:\n\n1. Continue sends a special system message instructing the model to focus on understanding and planning\n2. The tool list is filtered to include only read-only tools\n3. The model can use these tools to explore and analyze your codebase\n4. When you're ready to implement changes, you switch to Agent mode\n\n### Available tools in Plan mode\n\nPlan mode includes these read-only built-in tools:\n\n- **Read file** (`read_file`): Read the contents of any file in the project\n- **Read currently open file** (`read_currently_open_file`): Read the contents of the currently open file\n- **List directory** (`ls`): List files and directories\n- **Glob search** (`glob_search`): Search for files matching a pattern\n- **Grep search** (`grep_search`): Search file contents using regex patterns\n- **Fetch URL content** (`fetch_url_content`): Retrieve content from web URLs\n- **Search web** (`search_web`): Perform web searches for additional context\n- **View diff** (`view_diff`): View the current git diff\n- **View repo map** (`view_repo_map`): Get an overview of the repository structure\n- **View subdirectory** (`view_subdirectory`): Get a detailed view of a specific directory\n- **Codebase tool** (`codebase_tool`): Advanced codebase analysis capabilities\n\n### MCP tools support\n\nIn addition to built-in read-only tools, Plan mode also supports all MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. This allows integration with external services that provide additional context or analysis capabilities without modifying your local environment.\n\n<Info>\n  While Plan mode restricts built-in tools to read-only operations, MCP tools\n  are not filtered by Continue. Some MCP tools may have write capabilities that\n  could modify your system or external services. Always verify what actions your\n  MCP tools can perform before using them in Plan mode.\n</Info>\n\n## The planning workflow\n\nA typical Plan mode workflow follows these steps:\n\n1. **Exploration**: Use read-only tools to understand the current state\n2. **Analysis**: Identify what needs to change and potential impacts\n3. **Planning**: Develop a detailed plan for implementation\n4. **Verification**: Review the plan and ensure it addresses all requirements\n5. **Execution**: Switch to Agent mode to implement the plan\n\n### Example: Planning a refactor\n\n```\nUser: Help me plan a refactor to extract the authentication logic into a separate module\n\nPlan mode:\n1. Reads relevant files to understand current structure\n2. Analyzes dependencies and usage patterns\n3. Identifies all places that need updates\n4. Creates a step-by-step refactoring plan\n5. Suggests: \"Switch to Agent mode to implement this plan\"\n```\n\n## System message and behavior\n\nPlan mode uses a dedicated system message that:\n\n- Instructs the model to focus on understanding and planning\n- Emphasizes using only read-only tools\n- Reminds the model to suggest switching to Agent mode for implementation\n- Encourages thorough analysis before suggesting changes\n\n<Info>\n  The system message can be customized per model. See it [directly in\n  the\n  code](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/blob/main/core/llm/defaultSystemMessages.ts).\n</Info>\n\n## When to use Plan mode vs other modes\n\n### Use Plan mode when:\n\n- Exploring unfamiliar codebases\n- Planning complex refactors or features\n- Debugging and understanding issues\n- Reviewing code architecture\n- Creating implementation strategies\n\n### Use Chat mode when:\n\n- Having discussions without needing file access\n- Asking general programming questions\n- Getting explanations without exploring code\n\n### Use Agent mode when:\n\n- Ready to implement changes\n- Need to create or modify files\n- Want to run commands or tests\n- Implementing a plan developed in Plan mode\n"}

Instead, we wait until you have finished.\n- Caching: If your cursor is in a position that we've already generated a completion for, this completion is reused. For example, if you backspace, we'll be able to immediately show the suggestion you saw before.\n\n## Context Retrieval from Your Codebase\n\nContinue uses a number of retrieval methods to find relevant snippets from your codebase to include in the prompt.\n\n## Filtering and Post-Processing AI Suggestions\n\nLanguage models aren't perfect, but can be made much closer by adjusting their output. We do extensive post-processing on responses before displaying a suggestion, including:\n\n- Removing special tokens\n- Stopping early when regenerating code to avoid long, irrelevant output\n- Fixing indentation for proper formatting\n- Occasionally discarding low-quality responses, such as those with excessive repetition\n\nYou can learn more about how it works in the [Autocomplete deep dive](/customize/models#autocomplete).\n\n<Info>\n  **Looking for AI that predicts your next changes or additions?** Check out\n  [Next Edit](/ide-extensions/autocomplete/next-edit), an experimental feature that\n  proactively suggests code changes before you even start typing, going beyond\n  traditional autocomplete to anticipate entire code modifications.\n</Info>\n"}

For longer, more complex tasks, we recommend using [Chat](/ide-extensions/chat/quick-start).\n\n### How to Accept or Reject Changes\n\nProposed changes appear as inline diffs within your highlighted text.\n\nYou can navigate through each proposed change, accepting or rejecting them using `Cmd+Opt+Y` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Alt+Y` (Windows/Linux) to accept, or `Cmd+Opt+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Alt+N` (Windows/Linux) to reject.\n\nYou can also accept or reject all changes at once using `Cmd+Shift+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to accept, or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace` (Windows/Linux) to reject.\n\nIf you want to request a new suggestion for the same highlighted code section, you can use `Cmd+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) to re-prompt the model.\n\n## How to Use Edit in Jetbrains\n\nIn Jetbrains, Edit is implemented as an inline popup. See the header GIF example.\n"}

You send it a task, including any relevant information, and it replies with the text / code most likely to complete the task.

You send it a question, and it replies with an answer. You tell it to solve a problem, and it provides you a solution. You ask for some code, and it generates it.\n\n## Add Code Context to AI Chat by Highlighting Code\n\nYou select a code section with your mouse, press `cmd/ctrl` + `L` (VS Code) or `cmd/ctrl` + `J` (JetBrains) to send it to the LLM, and then ask for it to be explained to you or request it to be refactored in some way.\n\n## Use @ to Include Project Context in AI Chat Responses\n\nIf there is information from the codebase, documentation, IDE, or other tools that you want to include as context, you can type @ to select and include it as context. You can learn more about how to use this in [Chat context selection](/ide-extensions/chat/quick-start#how-to-use--for-additional-context).\n\n## Insert AI-Generated Code Changes Directly into Your File\n\nWhen the LLM replies with edits to a file, you can click the “Apply” button. This will update the existing code in the editor to reflect the suggested changes.\n\n## How to Begin a New AI Chat Session for a Different Coding Task\n\nOnce you complete a task and want to start a new one, press `cmd/ctrl` + `L` (VS Code) or `cmd/ctrl` + `J` (JetBrains) to begin a new session, ensuring only relevant context for the next task is provided to the LLM.\n\n## Change AI Models in Continue Chat for Different Coding Needs\n\nIf you have configured multiple models, you can switch between models using the dropdown or by pressing `cmd/ctrl` + `’`"}

Continue API Key\n\nAdd your Continue API key as a secret named `CONTINUE_API_KEY` in your repository:\n\n1. Go to your repository's Settings\n2. Navigate to Secrets and variables → Actions\n3. Click \"New repository secret\"\n4. Name: `CONTINUE_API_KEY`\n5. Value: Your Continue API key\n\n### 2. Continue Configuration\n\nSet up your review bot configuration in Continue:\n\n1. Create a configuration for your organization\n2. Configure the review bot settings\n3. Note your organization name and config path\n\n### 3. Workflow Permissions\n\nThe workflow requires these permissions:\n\n- `contents: read` - To checkout and read repository code\n- `pull-requests: write` - To post review comments on PRs\n- `issues: write` - To respond to comment triggers\n\n## Triggering Reviews\n\nThe action can be triggered in two ways:\n\n### Automatic Triggers\n\n- When a PR is opened by a team member (OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR)\n- When a PR is marked as \"ready for review\" by a team member\n\n### Manual Triggers\n\nTeam members can trigger reviews by commenting on any pull request:\n\n- `@continue-review` - Triggers a review\n\n## Review Output\n\nThe general review provides a structured comment that includes:\n\n- **Strengths**: What was done well in the PR\n- **Issues Found**: Categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)\n- **Suggestions**: Improvement recommendations\n- **Overall Assessment**: Final recommendation (APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT)\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Checks out repository code\n2. Fetches PR diff using GitHub CLI\n3. Generates a comprehensive review prompt\n4. Runs Continue CLI with specified configuration\n5. Posts review as a PR comment\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe recommend using the main branch:\n\n- `@main` - Uses the latest code from the main branch\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nuses: continuedev/continue/actions/general-review@main\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Review not triggering\n\n- Ensure the PR author or commenter has appropriate permissions (OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR)\n- Check that the workflow file is in the default branch\n- Verify the Continue API key is correctly set as a repository secret\n\n### No review output generated\n\n- Check the action logs for any errors\n- Verify your Continue configuration is correct\n- Ensure your Continue API key is valid\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues or questions:\n\n- [Continue Documentation](https://docs.continue.dev)\n- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/continuedev/continue/issues)\n- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/vapESyrFmJ)\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/src/e2e/spec.md","content":"# End-to-End Testing for Continue CLI\n\nThis document describes the principles, practices, and patterns for writing end-to-end (E2E) tests for the Continue CLI.\n\n## Overview\n\nEnd-to-end tests verify that the CLI functions correctly as a whole by executing the actual CLI binary and validating its behavior from the user's perspective. These tests help ensure that all components work together properly in a real-world environment.\n\n## Key Principles\n\n1. **Isolation**: Each test runs in a completely isolated environment with its own temporary directory\n2. **Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other and can be run in any order\n3. **Realistic Usage**: Tests should simulate how users actually interact with the CLI\n4. **Minimal Mocking**: Mock only external dependencies (like LLM APIs) when necessary\n5. **Thorough Cleanup**: Tests should clean up after themselves to avoid leaking resources\n\n## Test Structure\n\nA typical E2E test follows this structure:\n\n```typescript\ndescribe(\"E2E: Feature\", () => {\n  let context: any;\n\n  beforeEach(async () => {\n    context = await createTestContext();\n  });\n\n  afterEach(async () => {\n    await cleanupTestContext(context);\n  });\n\n  it(\"should do something\", async () => {\n    const result = await runCLI(context, {\n      args: [\"command\", \"--flag\"],\n    });\n\n    expect(result.exitCode).toBe(0);\n    expect(result.stdout).toContain(\"Expected output\");\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Test Context\n\nThe test context (`createTestContext()`) provides:\n\n- Temporary test directory (`context.testDir`)\n- Path to the CLI binary (`context.cliPath`)\n- Optional paths for config and session files\n\n## Core Testing Utilities\n\n### Basic CLI Execution\n\n```typescript\n// Run CLI with arguments\nconst result = await runCLI(context, {\n  args: [\"--help\"],\n});\n\n// Verify output and exit code\nexpect(result.exitCode).toBe(0);\nexpect(result.stdout).toContain(\"Continue CLI\");\n```\n\n### Testing with Input\n\n```typescript\n// Run CLI with input\nconst result = await runCLI(context, {\n  args: [\"-p\", \"Prompt with input\"],\n  input: \"User input\\n\",\n});\n```\n\n### Interactive Testing\n\n```typescript\n// For complex interactive flows\nconst result = await withInteractiveInput(\n  context,\n  [\"chat\"],\n  [\"First input\", \"Second input\"],\n);\n```\n\n### Testing Error Cases\n\n```typescript\n// Test error scenarios\nconst result = await runCLI(context, {\n  args: [\"--invalid-flag\"],\n  expectError: true,\n});\n\nexpect(result.exitCode).not.toBe(0);\nexpect(result.stderr).toContain(\"error\");\n```\n\n## Testing with Mock LLM\n\nFor tests involving AI models, we use a mock LLM server:\n\n```typescript\nlet mockServer: MockLLMServer;\n\nbeforeEach(async () => {\n  context = await createTestContext();\n  mockServer = await setupMockLLMTest(context, {\n    response: \"Hello World!\",\n  });\n});\n\nafterEach(async () => {\n  await cleanupMockLLMServer(mockServer);\n  await cleanupTestContext(context);\n});\n\nit(\"should get response from mock LLM\", async () => {\n  const result = await runCLI(context, {\n    args: [\"-p\", \"--config\", context.configPath, \"Hi\"],\n  });\n\n  expect(result.stdout).toContain(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n```\n\n### Advanced Mock LLM Features\n\n- **Dynamic responses** based on prompts:\n\n  ```typescript\n  mockServer = await setupMockLLMTest(context, {\n    response: (prompt) =>\n      prompt.includes(\"weather\") ? \"It's sunny!\" : \"I don't know\",\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **Non-streaming responses**:\n\n  ```typescript\n  mockServer = await setupMockLLMTest(context, {\n    response: \"All at once response\",\n    streaming: false,\n  });\n  ```\n\n- **Request tracking**:\n  ```typescript\n  expect(mockServer.requests).toHaveLength(1);\n  expect(mockServer.requests[0].body.messages[0].content).toBe(\"User prompt\");\n  ```\n\n## Testing Sessions and Configuration\n\n### Creating Test Configuration\n\n```typescript\nconst configPath = await createTestConfig(context, {\n  // Config object\n});\n```\n\n### Creating and Reading Sessions\n\n```typescript\n// Create a mock session\nawait createMockSession(context, [\n  { role: \"user\", content: \"Hello\" },\n  { role: \"assistant\", content: \"Hi there!\" },\n]);\n\n// Read the session\nconst session = await readSession(context);\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use descriptive test names** that explain what functionality is being tested\n2. **Keep tests focused** on specific functionality or user flows\n3. **Set appropriate timeouts** for tests that may take longer (especially with mock LLM)\n4. **Validate both happy path and error cases**\n5. **Test CLI flags and commands** thoroughly\n6. **Clean up resources** even if tests fail (use try/finally if needed)\n7. **Use realistic inputs** that match how users would interact with the CLI\n\n## Testing Specific Features\n\n### Testing Headless Mode\n\n```typescript\nconst result = await runCLI(context, {\n  args: [\"-p\", \"Prompt in headless mode\"],\n});\n```\n\n### Testing Interactive Mode\n\n```typescript\nconst result = await withInteractiveInput(\n  context,\n  [\"chat\"],\n  [\"User input\", \"/exit\"],\n);\n```\n\n### Testing Subcommands\n\n```typescript\nconst result = await runCLI(context, {\n  args: [\"login\", \"--help\"],\n});\n```\n\n## Debugging Tests\n\n- Set longer timeouts for complex tests: `}, 30000);` (30 seconds)\n- Examine the full output: `console.log(result.stdout, result.stderr)`\n- Check the test directory: `console.log(context.testDir)`\n- For intermittent failures, try running the test in isolation\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/src/ui/__tests__/README.md","content":"# TUI Testing Framework\n\nThis directory contains a comprehensive testing framework for the Continue CLI's Terminal User Interface (TUI) that supports running tests in both normal (local) and remote modes.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe testing framework ensures that the TUI behaves consistently whether running locally or connected to a remote `cn serve` instance. Most tests run in both modes automatically, verifying feature parity between local and remote operation.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Mock Remote Server (`mockRemoteServer.ts`)\n\nA mock Express server that simulates the `cn serve` endpoints:\n\n- `GET /state` - Returns current chat state\n- `POST /message` - Receives user messages and can simulate responses\n\n### 2. Test Helper (`TUIChat.testHelper.ts`)\n\nProvides utilities for writing tests that work in both modes:\n\n- `runTest()` - Run a single test in specified mode(s)\n- `runTestSuite()` - Run a test suite in specified mode(s)\n- Helper functions for common operations\n\n### 3. Test Files\n\n- `TUIChat.basic.test.tsx` - Basic UI and layout tests\n- `TUIChat.messages.test.tsx` - Message handling tests\n- `TUIChat.remote.test.tsx` - Remote-specific behavior tests\n- Additional test files for other features...\n\n## Writing Tests\n\n### Basic Test (runs in both modes)\n\n```typescript\nimport { runTest } from \"./TUIChat.testHelper.js\";\n\nrunTest(\"my test name\", async (ctx) => {\n  const { renderResult, mode, server } = ctx;\n\n  // Your test code here\n  const frame = renderResult.lastFrame();\n  expect(frame).toContain(\"Expected content\");\n\n  // Mode-specific logic if needed\n  if (mode === \"remote\" && server) {\n    // Remote-specific assertions\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Test Suite (runs all tests in both modes)\n\n```typescript\nimport { runTestSuite } from \"./TUIChat.testHelper.js\";\n\nrunTestSuite(\"My Test Suite\", () => {\n  runTest(\"test 1\", async (ctx) => {\n    // Test code\n  });\n\n  runTest(\"test 2\", async (ctx) => {\n    // Test code\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Mode-Specific Tests\n\n```typescript\n// Remote-only test\nrunTest(\n  \"remote-specific behavior\",\n  async (ctx) => {\n    // This only runs in remote mode\n  },\n  { mode: \"remote\" },\n);\n\n// Normal-only test\nrunTest(\n  \"local-specific behavior\",\n  async (ctx) => {\n    // This only runs in normal mode\n  },\n  { mode: \"normal\" },\n);\n```\n\n## Helper Functions\n\n### `sendMessage(ctx, message, waitTime?)`\n\nSends a message and waits for it to be processed:\n\n```typescript\nawait sendMessage(ctx, \"Hello world\");\n```\n\n### `waitForServerState(server, predicate, timeout?)`\n\nWaits for server state to match a condition (remote mode only):\n\n```typescript\nawait waitForServerState(server, (state) => state.messages.length > 0, 5000);\n```\n\n### `expectRemoteMode(frame)` / `expectNormalMode(frame)`\n\nVerify mode-specific UI indicators:\n\n```typescript\nif (mode === \"remote\") {\n  expectRemoteMode(frame);\n} else {\n  expectNormalMode(frame);\n}\n```\n\n## Server Setup\n\nFor tests that need specific server behavior:\n\n```typescript\nrunTest(\n  \"test with custom server\",\n  async (ctx) => {\n    // Test code\n  },\n  {\n    serverSetup: (server) => {\n      server.onMessage((msg) => {\n        // Custom response logic\n        server.simulateResponse(`Echo: ${msg}`);\n      });\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests\nnpm test\n\n# Run specific test file\nnpm test TUIChat.basic.test.tsx\n\n# Run with coverage\nnpm test -- --coverage\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Write mode-agnostic tests by default** - Most functionality should work the same in both modes\n2. **Use helper functions** - They handle mode-specific details automatically\n3. **Test server state in remote mode** - Verify both UI and server state for comprehensive coverage\n4. **Handle async operations properly** - Use appropriate wait times and state checks\n5. **Clean up resources** - The framework handles server lifecycle automatically\n\n## Debugging\n\n- Tests output the current mode in brackets: `[NORMAL MODE]` or `[REMOTE MODE]`\n- Server state can be inspected with `server.getState()`\n- Use `console.log(renderResult.lastFrame())` to see the current UI state\n- Mock server runs on a random port to avoid conflicts\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/src/commands/devbox-entrypoint.md","content":"# Devbox entrypoint behavior (cn serve)\n\nContext: runloop resumes a devbox by re-running the same entrypoint script, which invokes `cn serve --id <agentId> ...`. Because the entrypoint always replays, the CLI must avoid duplicating state on restart.\n\n- **Session reuse:** `serve` now calls `loadOrCreateSessionById` when `--id` is provided so the same session file is reused instead of generating a new UUID. This keeps chat history intact across suspend/resume.\n- **Skip replaying the initial prompt:** `shouldQueueInitialPrompt` checks existing history and only queues the initial prompt when there are no non-system messages. This prevents the first prompt from being resent when a suspended devbox restarts.\n- **Environment persistence:** The devbox entrypoint (control-plane) writes all env vars to `~/.continue/devbox-env` and sources it before `cn serve`, so keys survive suspend/resume. The CLI assumes env is already present.\n\nOperational notes:\n\n- Changing the entrypoint is expensive; prefer adapting CLI/session behavior as above.\n- When testing suspend/resume, confirm a single session file under `~/.continue/sessions` for the agent id and that follow-up messages append normally without replaying the first prompt.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/src/permissions/README.md","content":"# Tool Permissions System\n\nThe tool permissions system allows you to control which tools the AI can use and how it can use them. There are three permission levels:\n\n- **allow**: The tool will be executed automatically without asking for permission\n- **ask**: The tool will prompt the user for permission before execution\n- **exclude**: The tool will be filtered out entirely and won't be available to the AI\n\n## Default Policies\n\nThe system comes with sensible default policies:\n\n- Read-only tools (`readFile`, `listFiles`, `searchCode`, `fetch`) are **allowed** by default\n- Write operations (`writeFile`) require **confirmation** (ask)\n- Terminal commands (`runTerminalCommand`) require **confirmation** (ask)\n- MCP tools with IDE prefix are **allowed** by default\n- Other MCP tools require **confirmation** (ask)\n- Any unmatched tools default to **ask**\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. Tool Filtering (Exclude Policy)\n\nTools with \"exclude\" permission are filtered out before being sent to the AI model. This means the AI won't even know these tools exist.\n\n### 2. Permission Checking (Ask Policy)\n\nWhen the AI tries to use a tool with \"ask\" permission, the system will:\n\n1. Display a permission request in the UI\n2. Wait for user approval (y/n)\n3. Execute the tool if approved, or return an error if denied\n\n### 3. Automatic Execution (Allow Policy)\n\nTools with \"allow\" permission are executed immediately without user intervention.\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Core Components\n\n- **`types.ts`**: Defines the permission policy types and interfaces\n- **`defaultPolicies.ts`**: Contains the hardcoded default permission policies\n- **`permissionChecker.ts`**: Implements the permission checking logic\n- **`permissionManager.ts`**: Manages permission requests and user responses\n- **UI Components**: Handle displaying permission requests and collecting user input\n\n### Data Flow\n\n1. **Tool Loading**: `getAllowedTools()` in `streamChatResponse.ts` filters out excluded tools\n2. **Tool Execution**: Before executing each tool call, permissions are checked\n3. **User Interaction**: For \"ask\" policies, UI displays permission request\n4. **Execution**: Tool is executed or denied based on permission result\n\n## UI Integration\n\nThe permission system integrates with the existing chat UI:\n\n- Permission requests appear as special message types\n- Users can approve/deny with y/n keys\n- The decision is shown in the chat history\n- The system handles the async nature of permission requests\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nThe system is designed to be extensible for future features like:\n\n- Custom permission policies loaded from configuration\n- \"Remember this decision\" functionality\n- Argument-based permission matching (partially implemented)\n- Per-session or per-project permission overrides\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```typescript\n// Check permission for a tool call\nconst result = checkToolPermission({\n  name: \"writeFile\",\n  arguments: { path: \"/important.txt\", content: \"data\" },\n});\n\nif (result.permission === \"ask\") {\n  // Request user permission\n}\n```\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/spec/permissions.md","content":"# Permissions\n\n## Permission types\n\nTo make sure that users can oversee the actions of the LLM, we implement a permissions system. Every tool has one of the following permissions:\n\n- `allow`: The tool will be automatically called without asking\n- `ask`: We will ask the user before calling the tool, giving them the options to accept or reject\n- `exclude`: This tool will be completely excluded, so the model won't even know it exists\n\n## Rule precedence\n\nThere is a default set of permissions for the builtin tools in [`src/permissions/defaultPolicies.ts`](../src/permissions/defaultPolicies.ts). But these policies can be overriden by multiple layers. The order of precedence is as follows, which the earlier items taking precedence:\n\n1. **Mode policies** (highest priority - see [modes.md](./modes.md))\n2. Command line flags (`--allow`, `--ask`, `--exclude`)\n3. Permissions in `config.yaml` / configuration\n4. Permissions in `~/.continue/permissions.yaml`\n5. Default policies\n\n**Note:** Mode policies **completely override all other permission settings** in plan and auto modes. Available modes:\n\n- `normal`: No mode policies (uses existing configuration)\n- `plan`: **Absolute override** - excludes all write tools, allows only read tools (ignores user config)\n- `auto`: **Absolute override** - allows all tools without asking (ignores user config)\n\n## Tool matching patterns\n\nWe use a tool matching pattern to match tools to permissions. This format looks like the following:\n\n- `Read` matches any call to the `Read` tool\n- `Read(*)` also matches any call to the `Read` tool\n- `Read(**/*.ts)` matches any call to the `Read` tool where the primary parameter matches the glob pattern `**/*.ts`.\n\nNote that for an `exclude` policy, it doesn't make sense to have argument matching.\n\n## Command line flags\n\nEach of the `--allow`, `--ask`, and `--exclude` flags allow you to set the permission for a tool. Usage must be a \"tool matching pattern\" as described above for each flag, with each providing a policy that will be added to the list of policies in order.\n\n```bash\n# Allow Read, Ask Write, and Exclude Bash\ncn --allow Read --ask Write --exclude Bash\n\n# Start in plan mode (read-only tools only)\ncn --readonly \"Help me understand this codebase\"\n\n# Use mode switching during chat\ncn \"Let me work on this feature\"  # Starts in normal mode\n# Then use Shift+Tab to cycle through modes\n```\n\n## `config.yaml` / Configuration (implement later)\n\n::: info\nThis should not be implemented yet.\n:::\n\nTo let users define their permissions as a part of their custom assistant, they can do so in the permissions section of `config.yaml` or their configuration:\n\n```yaml\npermissions:\n  allow:\n    - Read(*)\n\n  ask:\n    - Write(**/*.py)\n\n  exclude:\n    - Write\n```\n\n## `~/.continue/permissions.yaml` (personal settings)\n\nIt would be frustrating for users to have to set the same permissions across all of their assistants, so we provide them a file for personal settings. It should be basically equivalent to the `permissions` section of `config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml title=\"~/.continue/permissions.yaml\"\nallow:\n  - Read(*)\n\nask:\n  - Write(**/*.py)\n\nexclude:\n  - Write\n```\n\nExcept that it's important to understand that this file is _not_ intended to be edited by the user. It is only for persistence, and users should interact with their permissions by using the TUI.\n\nThis file should be created the first time that the CLI starts.\n\n## Headless mode permissions\n\nWhen running in headless mode (using the `-p` or `--print` flag), the CLI uses the same default policies as normal mode, but with different behavior for tools that require confirmation:\n\n- **Normal mode**: Write operations and terminal commands require confirmation (`ask`) - user is prompted\n- **Headless mode**: Same default policies, but tools requiring confirmation (`ask`) will cause the process to exit with an error message\n\nTo use tools that normally require confirmation in headless mode, you must explicitly allow them:\n\n```bash\n# Headless mode with explicit permissions for write operations\ncn -p --allow write_file \"Write a hello world script\"\n\n# Headless mode with wildcard permission (allow all tools)\ncn -p --allow \"*\" \"Write and run a script\"\n\n# Headless mode with specific restrictions\ncn -p --exclude run_terminal_command \"Clean up the codebase\"\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that headless mode is secure by default while providing clear guidance on how to enable the needed permissions.\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/spec/index.md","content":"# `cn`\n\n## Overall development goals\n\nFight to keep `cn` simple. This is an active process. The default is that `cn` will become disastrously complicated.\n\n### Maintainability\n\nMaintain minimal code (avoid new features unless there is overwhelming demand or they remove a clear blocker for many users). If someone offers up a feature you should seek to understand what they actually want and then decide as a maintainer of `cn` whether this can fit into some larger concept in a simple way. If someone asks to make something configurable, you should probably consider just changing the default.\n\n### Don't write code by hand\n\nUse `cn` for everything. You should very rarely need to write code by hand. If you find yourself doing this outside of small tweaks, you should ask what about the codebase is causing `cn` to be unable to make the change.\n\nIf we build a system that allows us to entrust all changes to `cn` then it will be more reliable than us writing the code. Not because we can't write better code, but because `cn` is consistently thorough + it will force us to build the right systems around the code.\n\n### Do not test by hand\n\nIf you find yourself using `npm run start` to test that existing functionality is still working, this means that you are missing a test. A green check mark from `npm test` should be full proof that the code can be shipped. See our testing strategies [here](./testing-strategies.md).\n\nFor new features you obviously need to run them yourself to apply your taste. `cn` can't match that right now.\n\n### Minimize the number of concepts\n\nThe spec for `cn` (if it were to be fully written out) should be relatively short. This helps keep the code / spec consistent. It also allows us to keep the docs short and makes it easier for users to understand.\n\n### Low tolerance\n\nTolerance for the following should be very close to zero:\n\n- Un-addressed code reviews\n- Failing tests\n- Flaky tests\n- Sentry issues\n\nIf we are inundated then we should build a system to solve that. For example, if it is tiresome to address all AI code reviews, then set up a trigger to have `cn` automatically address them.\n\n### Start with a spec\n\nHigh level concepts / features should have a spec when possible. Good examples of this are [modes](./modes.md), [permissions](./permissions.md), [OTLP metrics](./otlp-metrics.md), and [wire format](./wire-format.md). Like code, the spec can and should be largely auto-generated.\n\n## Codebase Design\n\n- We intentionally write different implementations of the \"loop\" instead of trying to build a single engine that can be used across TUI, headless mode, `cn serve`, and more. So far, it would be more work than it is worth to add this abstraction.\n- \"Everything is a service.\" Nobody (human or AI) should need to re-invent a polling mechanism or way to store / update state. This decision has been made already so we can focus on the business logic. The service setup lets us easily keep reactive state and avoid React anti-patterns like `useEffect`.\n- We use `ink` for UI, following the same usual React principles that we do elsewhere. Keep [components](../src/ui/components/) small, avoid `useEffect`, group logic into [hooks](../src/hooks).\n- Always use the [logger](../src/util/logger.ts) instead of `console.log`.\n- Use commander to define [commands](../src/commands/BaseCommandOptions.ts)\n- `cn remote` is intended to act the same as `cn`'s TUI in almost every way. There is a test helper that allows us to run any e2e test in _both_ remote and normal modes to ensure this is true.\n"}

No TTY available for interactive mode.\nFor non-interactive use, run with -p flag:\n  cn -p \"your prompt here\"\n```\n\n### Missing Prompt in Headless Mode\n\n```\nError: A prompt is required when using the -p/--print flag, unless --prompt or --agent is provided.\n\nUsage examples:\n  cn -p \"please review my current git diff\"\n  echo \"hello\" | cn -p\n  cn -p \"analyze the code in src/\"\n  cn -p --agent my-org/my-agent\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### CLI Hangs in Docker/CI\n\n**Cause**: CLI attempting to read stdin in TTY-less environment\n\n**Solution**: Ensure using `-p` flag with a prompt:\n\n```bash\ncn -p \"your prompt\" --config config.yaml\n```\n\n### \"Cannot start TUI\" Error\n\n**Cause**: Attempting interactive mode in TTY-less environment\n\n**Solution**: Use headless mode:\n\n```bash\ncn -p \"your prompt\"\n```\n\n### Raw Mode Error\n\n**Cause**: Terminal doesn't support raw mode (required by Ink)\n\n**Solution**: Use headless mode instead of interactive mode\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **Fail Fast**: Detect environment early and fail with clear messages\n2. **Explicit Separation**: No code path should allow Ink to load in headless mode\n3. **No Blocking**: Never block on stdin in TTY-less environments\n4. **Clear Errors**: Provide actionable error messages with examples\n5. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for TTY-less scenarios\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\n- [x] Add TTY detection utilities\n- [x] Protect stdin reading in headless mode\n- [x] Guard TUI initialization\n- [x] Validate headless mode inputs\n- [x] Configure logger for TTY-less output\n- [x] Update test helpers\n- [x] Add TTY-less tests\n- [x] Document TTY-less support\n\n## Related Files\n\n- `src/util/cli.ts` - TTY detection utilities\n- `src/util/stdin.ts` - Stdin reading protection\n- `src/ui/index.ts` - TUI initialization guards\n- `src/commands/chat.ts` - Mode routing and validation\n- `src/util/logger.ts` - Output configuration\n- `src/test-helpers/cli-helpers.ts` - Test support\n- `src/e2e/headless-minimal.test.ts` - TTY-less tests\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/spec/mcp.md","content":"# Continue CLI Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration\n\n## Intro\n\nModel Context Protocol is a protocol for giving models access to resources and tools. MCP servers can run locally (stdio) or be remote (http/streamable/etc). See https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification. The Continue CLI uses MCP to extend model's capabilities with MCP prompts and tools. MCP server configurations are stored in the `mcpServers` field of an assistant/config.yaml configuration.\n\n## Secret Resolution\n\nMCP server configurations often require secrets (API keys, tokens, etc.) referenced using template variables like `${{ secrets.API_KEY }}`. The CLI resolves these secrets in the following order:\n\n1. **Organization/Package Secrets**: First attempts to resolve secrets through the Continue API for organization or package-level secrets\n2. **Local Environment Variables**: Falls back to local environment variables if:\n   - The API secret exists but isn't accessible locally (e.g., in devboxes or restricted environments)\n   - The secret isn't found in organization/package secrets\n\nLocal environment variables are checked in this priority order:\n\n- `process.env` (runtime environment variables)\n- `~/.continue/.env`\n- `<workspace>/.continue/.env`\n- `<workspace>/.env`\n\nThis fallback mechanism ensures MCP servers can start successfully in environments where organization secrets aren't accessible, such as development containers or CI/CD pipelines, by allowing environment variables to provide the required credentials.\n\n## MCP Service\n\nThe CLI has an MCP Service should manage connections to MCP servers and provide state to the terminal app regarding MCP server connections.\nService initialization for MCP servers can take especially long, so it should not block service initialization. Instead, initialization should kick off server connections and then resolve.\nAll configured server connections can be initialized simultaneously using Promise.all\nEach server configuration should have its own connection and state separated, but the service should also have an easy way to retrieve all tools and prompts from all servers to pass to the model.\nServers should have a status \"idle\", \"connecting\", \"connected\", or \"error\". Only \"connected\" servers contribute prompts and tools.\nIf a server successfully connects but there is an error retrieving prompts or tools, it should have an array of warning messages that can be accessed in the terminal app.\nWhen the process exits, all servers should be shut down and disconnected.\nOnly MCP servers for the CURRENT config should be loaded\n\n- Logs from MCP servers should be routed through the winston logger, not the standard console.log (since this is a terminal app)\n\n## MCP slash command\n\nUsers can manage MCP connections using the /mcp slash command.\n/mcp shows a menu with the following options\n\n- \"No servers\" if there are no servers\n- Restart all servers\n- Stop all servers\n- View servers\n- Back (esc also goes back)\n\nView servers should open a submenu that has each server name with its status icon\n\n- red if error, yellow if warnings, green if connected, gray if idle\n- \"No Servers\" if there are none\n- Back (esc also goes back)\n\nFinally, selecting a server opens a sub-submenu that keeps the name/icon as header and lists\n\n- Back (esc also goes back)\n- Restart server\n- Stop server\n- warnings the server currently has\n- prompts the server contributes\n- tools the server contributes\n"}

If in shell mode, exits shell mode after submission and shows the pending Shell tool call immediately.\n- Shift+Enter: new line.\n- Backslash (\\) at end-of-line: inserts a new line (line continuation) as usual.\n- Esc: if only ! (trimmed) is present, clears input and exits shell mode; otherwise cancels streaming or closes suggestions depending on context.\n\nScope / Modes\n\n- Shell mode applies to interactive (TUI/standard) CLI usage. It is not part of headless (-p/--print) processing.\n\nError handling\n\n- Command execution errors are captured and surfaced in the tool call as status error with human-readable error text (including Stderr when available).\n\nExamples\n\n- \"!git status\" → shows a Shell tool call immediately, then populates with the git status output.\n- \"!echo hello\" → shows a Shell tool call immediately, then output \"hello\".\n- \"!some-unknown-cmd\" → shows a Shell tool call immediately, then sets status to error with an error message.\n"}

The architecture consists of:\n\n### Core Components\n\n1. **Entry Point** (`src/index.ts`): Main CLI logic with two modes:\n\n   - **Headless mode**: Non-interactive mode for automation/CI\n   - **TUI mode**: Terminal User Interface using Ink/React\n   - **Standard mode**: Traditional readline-based chat interface\n\n2. **Authentication** (`src/auth/`): WorkOS-based authentication system\n\n   - `ensureAuth.ts`: Handles authentication flow\n   - `workos.ts`: WorkOS configuration and token management\n\n3. **Continue SDK Integration** (`src/continueSDK.ts`): Initializes the Continue SDK client with:\n\n   - API key authentication\n   - Assistant configuration (slug-based)\n   - Organization support\n\n4. **Terminal UI** (`src/ui/`): React/Ink-based TUI components\n\n   - `TUIChat.tsx`: Main chat interface component\n   - `UserInput.tsx`: Input handling with multi-line support\n   - `TextBuffer.ts`: Text display utilities\n\n5. **Tools System** (`src/tools/`): Built-in development tools including:\n\n   - File operations (read, write, list)\n   - Code search functionality\n   - Terminal command execution\n   - Diff viewing\n   - Exit tool (headless mode only)\n\n6. **MCP Integration** (`src/mcp.ts`): Model Context Protocol service for extended tool capabilities\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI response streaming (`streamChatResponse.ts`)\n- **Slash Commands**: Built-in commands like `/help`, `/exit` (`slashCommands.ts`)\n- **Multi-mode Operation**: Supports TUI, headless, and standard chat modes\n- **Tool Integration**: Extensible tool system for development tasks\n\n### Testing Setup\n\n- Uses Vitest with TypeScript and ESM support\n- Configuration in `vitest.config.ts`\n- Tests should be written with `.test.ts` extension\n- No existing test files found - tests should be added when writing new functionality\n- Run tests using `npm run test path/or/pattern`\n\n### Build System\n\n- TypeScript compilation with declaration files\n- ESNext target with NodeNext module resolution\n- Outputs to `dist/` directory\n- Source maps and inline sources enabled\n- JSX support for React components\n- Relative import paths require explicit file extensions, e.g. 'from \"./test.js\"' instead of 'from \"./test\"'\n\n### Important rules\n\n- Whenever you create / update a test, you should run the test to be certain that it passes\n- If you ever create a PR, you should be sure to check the formatting and linting first with `npm run format` and `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/BUILD.md","content":"# Build Process Documentation\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Continue CLI uses esbuild to bundle the application along with local packages (`@continuedev/config-yaml` and `@continuedev/openai-adapters`) into a single distributable file. This ensures that users who install the CLI from npm don't need to worry about local file references.\n\n## Build Steps\n\n1. **Build packages**: `cd ../../ && node ./scripts/build-packages.js`\n2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`\n3. **Build**: `npm run build`\n   - This first builds the local packages\n   - Then bundles everything with esbuild\n\n## How it Works\n\n### Bundling Strategy\n\nThe `build.mjs` script uses esbuild to:\n\n- Bundle all TypeScript/JavaScript code into a single ES module\n- Include local packages (`@continuedev/config-yaml`, `@continuedev/openai-adapters`) directly in the bundle\n- Keep problematic or native dependencies external (e.g., `@sentry/profiling-node`, `winston`, `express`)\n- Create a wrapper script (`dist/cn.js`) with the proper shebang for CLI execution\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Local Package Bundling**: Local packages are bundled directly, avoiding `file:` reference issues\n- **Stub for Optional Dependencies**: `react-devtools-core` is stubbed to prevent runtime errors\n- **CommonJS Compatibility**: Adds `createRequire` to support packages that use dynamic requires\n- **Source Maps**: Generates source maps for debugging\n- **Metadata**: Creates `dist/meta.json` with bundle analysis information\n\n## Testing\n\n### Smoke Tests\n\nRun smoke tests to verify the build:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test:smoke\n```\n\nThe smoke tests verify:\n\n- Bundle files exist\n- CLI commands work (--version, --help)\n- Bundle size is reasonable (<20MB)\n- Local packages are properly bundled\n- No missing runtime dependencies\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n1. **Module not found errors**: Check if the module needs to be added to the external list in `build.mjs`\n2. **Native module issues**: Native modules should be marked as external\n3. **Bundle too large**: Review bundled packages in `dist/meta.json` and consider marking large packages as external\n\n### Analyzing the Bundle\n\nAfter building, check `dist/meta.json` to see:\n\n- What packages were bundled\n- Bundle size breakdown\n- Input/output file mappings\n\n## Publishing\n\nWhen publishing to npm:\n\n1. The bundled files in `dist/` are included\n2. Users install via `npm install -g @continuedev/cli`\n3. The `cn` command becomes available globally\n4. No local file references or missing dependencies\n"}

{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/docs/artifact-uploads.md","content":"# Artifact Upload Architecture\n\n## Overview\n\nThe artifact upload feature enables Continue agents running in devboxes to upload arbitrary files (screenshots, videos, logs) to agent session storage for review and debugging purposes. The architecture uses a two-step presigned URL pattern for secure, performant uploads.\n\n## Architecture Pattern: Presigned URLs\n\n### Why Presigned URLs?\n\nThe artifact upload system uses **presigned URLs** for direct client-to-S3 uploads rather than proxying files through the backend. This design provides several benefits:\n\n1. **Security**: The backend controls who can upload, validates file types/sizes, and enforces storage limits before issuing a presigned URL. The agent cannot bypass these validations.\n\n2. **Performance**: Files upload directly from the devbox to S3, avoiding bandwidth costs and latency of routing through the backend API server.\n\n3. **Scalability**: The backend doesn't become a bottleneck for file uploads. S3 handles the heavy lifting of data transfer.\n\n4. **Simplicity**: Presigned URLs are time-limited (15 minutes), self-contained credentials that require no complex token management.\n\n## Two-Step Upload Flow\n\n### Step 1: Request Presigned URL\n\nThe agent requests a presigned upload URL from the backend:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```http\nPOST /agents/artifacts/upload-url\nAuthorization: Bearer <CONTINUE_API_KEY>\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"agentSessionId\": \"<session-id>\",\n  \"filename\": \"screenshot.png\",\n  \"contentType\": \"image/png\",\n  \"fileSize\": 1048576\n}\n```\n\n**Backend Validation:**\n\n- Authenticates the API key and verifies session ownership\n- Validates filename (no path traversal, allowed extension)\n- Validates file size against per-file limit (50MB default)\n- Validates content type against allowlist\n- Checks total session storage against limit (500MB default)\n\n**Response (if validation passes):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/sessions/org/abc123/artifacts/screenshot.png?X-Amz-...\",\n  \"key\": \"sessions/org/abc123/artifacts/screenshot.png\",\n  \"expiresIn\": 900\n}\n```\n\n**Response (if validation fails):**\n\n```http\n400 Bad Request\n\n{\n  \"error\": \"File size exceeds maximum allowed (50MB)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Upload to S3\n\nThe agent uploads the file directly to S3 using the presigned URL:\n\n**Request:**\n\n```http\nPUT <presigned-url>\nContent-Type: image/png\n<file-contents>\n```\n\nS3 validates the presigned URL signature and accepts the upload. The backend is not involved in this step.\n\n## Storage Organization\n\nArtifacts are stored in S3 with the following path structure:\n\n```\nsessions/\n  user/\n    <userId>/\n      <sessionId>/\n        artifacts/\n          screenshot.png\n          video.mp4\n          debug.log\n        session.json        # Session state (existing)\n        diff.txt           # Git diff (existing)\n  org/\n    <organizationId>/\n      <sessionId>/\n        artifacts/\n          ...\n```\n\nThis structure:\n\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `session.json` and `diff.txt` files\n- Isolates user/org data for security\n- Groups all session-related files together\n- Allows simple recursive deletion when a session is removed\n\n## File Type and Size Limits\n\n### Allowed File Types\n\nThe system validates both file extensions and MIME types:\n\n**Images:** `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`\n**Videos:** `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.webm`\n**Text/Logs:** `.log`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.csv`, `.html`\n\nContent types are validated against an allowlist to prevent uploading executable files or other potentially dangerous content.\n\n### Size Limits\n\nTwo limits are enforced:\n\n1. **Per-File Limit:** 50MB (configurable via `ARTIFACT_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`)\n2. **Total Session Storage:** 500MB (configurable via `ARTIFACT_MAX_TOTAL_SIZE_MB`)\n\nThe backend calculates total storage by summing all files under the session's S3 prefix before issuing presigned URLs. This prevents a single session from consuming excessive storage.\n\n## CLI Usage\n\n### Using the UploadArtifact Tool (Recommended)\n\nThe `UploadArtifact` tool is available when running with the beta flag:\n\n```bash\ncn serve --id <agentSessionId> --beta-upload-artifact-tool\n```\n\nAgents can then use the built-in `UploadArtifact` tool to upload files:\n\n```typescript\n// The agent calls this tool with the file path\n{\n  \"name\": \"UploadArtifact\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePath\": \"/tmp/screenshot.png\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe tool will:\n\n- Validate the file exists and is an allowed type\n- Check file size limits (50MB max per file)\n- Upload to session storage\n- Return success message or detailed error\n\n**Tool Description:** \"Upload a file (screenshot, video, log) to the session artifacts for user review. Supported formats: images (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, webp), videos (mp4, mov, avi, webm), and text files (log, txt, json, xml, csv, html). Maximum file size: 50MB. **If an artifact with the same filename already exists, it will be overwritten with the new file.**\"\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- Must run with `--id <agentSessionId>` (agent mode)\n- Must enable `--beta-upload-artifact-tool` flag\n- User must be authenticated (`cn login`)\n\n### Programmatic Upload (Service API)\n\nFor custom implementations, use the service directly:\n\n```typescript\nimport { services } from \"./services/index.js\";\n\nconst result = await services.artifactUpload.uploadArtifact({\n  agentSessionId: process.env.AGENT_SESSION_ID,\n  filePath: \"/tmp/screenshot.png\",\n  accessToken: process.env.CONTINUE_API_KEY,\n});\n\nif (result.success) {\n  console.log(`Uploaded: ${result.filename}`);\n} else {\n  console.error(`Failed: ${result.error}`);\n}\n```\n\n### Multiple Files\n\n```typescript\nconst results = await services.artifactUpload.uploadArtifacts(\n  process.env.AGENT_SESSION_ID,\n  [\"/tmp/screenshot1.png\", \"/tmp/screenshot2.png\", \"/tmp/debug.log\"],\n  process.env.CONTINUE_API_KEY,\n);\n\nresults.forEach((result) => {\n  console.log(`${result.filename}: ${result.success ? \"✓\" : \"✗\"}`);\n});\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nThe CLI requires these environment variables for artifact uploads:\n\n- `CONTINUE_API_KEY`: Bearer token for backend authentication\n- `CONTINUE_API_BASE`: API base URL (defaults to `https://api.continue.dev/`)\n- `AGENT_SESSION_ID`: The current agent session identifier\n\nThese are automatically provided when running in Continue's devbox environment.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Validation Errors (400)\n\n- Invalid filename (path traversal, disallowed extension)\n- File too large (exceeds per-file limit)\n- Storage limit exceeded (session total > 500MB)\n- Invalid content type\n\n### Authentication Errors (401/403)\n\n- Missing or invalid API key\n- User doesn't own the agent session\n\n### Upload Errors (S3)\n\n- Network failure during upload\n- Presigned URL expired (15-minute timeout)\n- S3 service error\n\nAll errors are logged and returned with descriptive messages. Failed uploads don't crash the agent - they return an error result that the agent can handle gracefully.\n\n## Frontend Access\n\nThe frontend can list and download artifacts using:\n\n**List artifacts:**\n\n```http\nGET /agents/{agentSessionId}/artifacts\nAuthorization: Bearer <API_KEY>\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"artifacts\": [\n    {\n      \"filename\": \"screenshot.png\",\n      \"size\": 1048576,\n      \"sizeFormatted\": \"1.0 MB\",\n      \"lastModified\": \"2025-12-08T10:30:00Z\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Download artifact:**\n\n```http\nGET /agents/{agentSessionId}/artifacts/{filename}/download\nAuthorization: Bearer <API_KEY>\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/...\",\n  \"expiresIn\": 3600\n}\n```\n\nThe frontend then uses the presigned download URL to fetch the artifact directly from S3.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid API keys tied to user/org accounts\n2. **Authorization**: Session ownership is verified before issuing presigned URLs\n3. **Path Traversal Prevention**: Filenames are validated to prevent `../` attacks\n4. **Content Validation**: File types are restricted via extension and MIME type checks\n5. **Rate Limiting**: Storage limits prevent abuse (per-file and total session limits)\n6. **Time-Limited URLs**: Presigned URLs expire after 15 minutes for uploads, 1 hour for downloads\n7. **Storage Isolation**: Files are scoped to user/org prefixes, preventing cross-tenant access\n\n## Design Trade-offs\n\n### Chosen: No Database Tracking\n\n**Decision:** Store artifacts as files in S3 without tracking individual files in the database.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Simpler implementation (no new database tables)\n- Files are the source of truth (no sync issues between DB and S3)\n- Fast listing via S3 API (ListObjects)\n- Automatic cleanup when deleting session folder\n\n**Trade-off:** Cannot query artifacts across sessions or track metadata without scanning S3.\n\n### Chosen: Overwrite on Name Collision\n\n**Decision:** If the same filename is uploaded twice, the last upload wins.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Simpler than versioning or auto-renaming\n- Common use case: agent re-uploading updated screenshot\n- Reduces storage consumption\n\n**Trade-off:** No version history for artifacts.\n\n### Chosen: Direct S3 Upload (Presigned URLs)\n\n**Decision:** Use presigned URLs instead of proxying files through backend.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- Better performance (no backend bottleneck)\n- Lower cost (no backend bandwidth charges)\n- Proven pattern (already used in StorageSyncService)\n\n**Trade-off:** Backend cannot inspect file contents before upload (relies on validation at URL generation).\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- **Compression**: Automatically compress screenshots/videos before upload\n- **Retention Policies**: Auto-delete artifacts after N days\n- **Artifact Types**: Support more file types (PDFs, archives)\n- **Preview Generation**: Generate thumbnails for images/videos\n- **Streaming**: Support large file uploads with multipart upload\n- **Metadata**: Attach custom metadata to artifacts (tags, descriptions)\n\n---\n\nThis document describes the initial artifact upload implementation. Update it when the architecture evolves.\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/cli/docs/storage-sync.md","content":"# Storage Sync Flow for `cn serve`\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `--id <storageId>` flag enables the `cn serve` command to periodically persist session state to an external Continue-managed storage bucket. On startup, the CLI exchanges the provided `storageId` for two pre-signed S3 URLs - one for `session.json` and one for `diff.txt` - and then pushes fresh copies of those files every 30 seconds.\n\nThis document captures the responsibilities for both the CLI and backend components so we can iterate on the feature together.\n\n## CLI Responsibilities\n\n- **Flag plumbing**: When `cn serve` is invoked with `--id <storageId>`, the CLI treats that value as an opaque identifier.\n- **API key auth**: The CLI attaches the user-level Continue API key (same mechanism we already use for other authenticated requests) to backend calls.\n- **Presign handshake**:\n  1. On startup, issue `POST https://api.continue.dev/agents/storage/presigned-url` with JSON payload `{ \"storageId\": \"<storageId>\" }`.\n  2. Expect a response payload containing two pre-signed `PUT` URLs and their target object keys:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"session\": {\n         \"key\": \"sessions/<sessionId>/session.json\",\n         \"putUrl\": \"https://<s3-host>/...\"\n       },\n       \"diff\": {\n         \"key\": \"sessions/<sessionId>/diff.txt\",\n         \"putUrl\": \"https://<s3-host>/...\"\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n  3. If the call fails, log and continue without remote storage (no retries yet).\n- **Periodic uploads**:\n  - Every 30 seconds (configurable later), serialize the in-memory session to `session.json` and fetch the `/diff` payload to produce `diff.txt`.\n  - Upload both artifacts using their respective `PUT` URLs. For now we overwrite the same objects each cycle.\n  - Errors should be logged but non-fatal; the server keeps running.\n  - If the repo check fails (no git repo or missing `main`), `diff.txt` uploads an empty string and we log the condition once for debugging.\n\n## Backend Responsibilities\n\n- **Endpoint surface**: `POST /agents/storage/presigned-url` accepts a JSON body `{ \"storageId\": string }`.\n- **Authentication**: Leverage the caller's Continue API key (the request arrives with the standard `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` header). Apply normal auth/tenant validation so users can only request URLs tied to their account/org.\n- **URL issuance**:\n  - Resolve `storageId` into the desired S3 prefix (e.g., `sessions/<org>/<storageId>/`).\n  - Generate two short-lived pre-signed `PUT` URLs: one for `session.json`, one for `diff.txt`.\n  - Return both URLs and their keys in the response payload described above.\n- **Expiration**: URLs are issued with a 60-minute TTL. The CLI automatically refreshes them before expiry (see URL Refresh Strategy below).\n\n## URL Refresh Strategy\n\nPre-signed URLs are automatically refreshed using a dual-strategy approach:\n\n1. **Proactive Refresh**: URLs are refreshed at the 50-minute mark (10 minutes before expiry) to prevent disruption\n2. **Reactive Refresh**: If a 403 Forbidden error is detected (indicating expired URLs), an immediate refresh is triggered\n3. **Error Handling**: Upload errors are logged but non-fatal; the service continues running with automatic recovery\n\nThis ensures continuous operation during devbox suspension, network interruptions, and clock drift.\n\n## Open Questions & Future Enhancements\n\n- **Upload cadence**: The 30-second interval is hard-coded for now. Consider making it configurable in both CLI and backend policies.\n- **Error telemetry**: Decide if repeated upload failures should trip analytics or circuit breakers.\n- **Diff source**: `diff.txt` currently mirrors the `/diff` endpoint response. Confirm backend expectations for format and size limits.\n- **Security**: We might want to sign responses or enforce stricter scope on `storageId` mapping (e.g., require both org + storageId and validate ownership).\n\n---\n\nThis document should evolve alongside implementation details; update it whenever the API contract or client behavior changes.\n"}

Communication occurs over stdin/stdout.\n\n## Environment Setup\n\n### IDE Installation\n\nContinue is built with JDK version 17 (as specified in [`./build.gradle.kts`](./build.gradle.kts)), which can be\ndownloaded from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).\n\nWe recommend using IntelliJ IDEA, which you can download from\nthe [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).\n\nBoth Ultimate and Community (free) editions are suitable for this project, although Ultimate has better debugging (see\nnotes below).\n\n### IDE configuration\n\n- Enable code formatting on save: `Settings | Tools | Actions on Save | Reformat code`\n\n#### Recommended plugins\n\n- [Thread Access Info](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16815-thread-access-info) - adds an extra debug panel\n  showing possible thread access violation (according to Intellij Platform SDK guidelines)\n- [File Expander](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11940-file-expander) - allows you to easily preview archives as\n  directories (like `build/distributions/continue-*.zip`)\n\n### Node.js Requirements\n\nThis project requires Node.js version 20.19.0 (LTS) or higher. You have two options for installation:\n\n1. Download and install directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download).\n2. If you're using NVM (Node Version Manager), set the correct Node.js version for this project by running `nvm use` in\n   the project root.\n\n### Install all dependencies\n\n- Unix: `./scripts/install-dependencies.sh`\n- Windows: `.\\scripts\\install-dependencies.ps1`\n\n### Misc\n\n- Ensure that you have the Gradle plugin installed\n\n## Development Workflow\n\n### Running the extension in debug mode\n\nSelect the `Run Continue` task in the top right corner of the IDE and then select the \"Debug\" option.\n\n> In community edition, use `Run Continue (CE)` instead, which uses shell scripts instead of Ultimate-only node configs.\n> If you want to debug the core in CE, you'll need to quit the `Start Core Dev Server (CE)` process and run the core in\n> a\n> different environment that supports debugging, such as VS Code (Launch \"Core Binary\").\n\n![run-extension-screenshot](../../media/run-continue-intellij.png)\n\nThis should open a new instance on IntelliJ with the extension installed.\n\n### Accessing files in the `.continue` directory\n\nWhen running the `Start Core Dev Server` task, we set the location of your Continue directory to\n`./extensions/.continue-debug`. This is to\nallow for changes to your `config.json` and other files during development, without affecting your actual configuration.\n\n### Viewing logs\n\nWhen using the `Run Continue` task, we automatically tail both prompt logs and IDE logs.\n\n#### Viewing more IDE logs\n\nYou can selectively increase the log granularity (e.g., debug-level logs) as follows:\n\n- Navigate to `Help | Diagnostic Tools | Debug Log Settings...`\n- Add a line in the format: `com.intellij.diagnostic:debug`\n\nYou can find more information about this feature in [official docs](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/articles/SUPPORT-A-43/How-to-enable-debug-logging-in-IntelliJ-IDEA).\n\n### Developing `build.plugin.kts`\n\nIf in doubt, check out the\nofficial [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template).\nThese templates are the most up-to-date examples of how to correctly customize the plugin build scripts.\n\nAlso, check out\nthe [useful recipes](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/tools-intellij-platform-gradle-plugin-recipes.html)\nfor common problems.\n\n### Adding new extensions in `plugin.xml`\n\nThere's a tool called [JetBrains Platform Explorer](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/intellij-platform-explorer) that\naggregates plugin metadata and allows you to filter by specific\nextension points. If you're having trouble implementing a feature that's not officially documented,\nyou can learn from other open source plugins.\n\n### Reloading changes\n\n- `extensions/intellij`: Attempt to reload changed classes by selecting\n  _Run | Debugging Actions | Reload Changed Classes`_\n  - This will often fail on new imports, schema changes etc. In that case, you need to stop and restart the extension\n- `gui`: Changes will be reloaded automatically\n- `core`: Run `npm run build -- --os [darwin | linux | win32]` from the `binary` directory (requires\n  restarting the\n  `Start Core Dev Server` task)\n\n### Setting breakpoints\n\n- `extensions/intellij`: Breakpoints can be set in Intellij\n- `gui`: You'll need to set explicit `debugger` statements in the source code, or through the browser dev tools\n- `core`: Breakpoints can be set in Intellij (requires restarting the `Start Core Dev Server` task)\n  - If you have Community Edition installed, you won't be able to use breakpoints in IntelliJ. Instead, you can start\n    the `Core Binary` task in VS Code and set breakpoints in that IDE.\n\n### Available Gradle tasks\n\nTo see the list of Gradle tasks available, you can run the following:\n\n```shell\n./gradlew tasks\n```\n\nA handful of the most relevant tasks are outlined below:\n\n```shell\nbuild - Assembles and tests this project.\nclean - Deletes the build directory.\ndependencies - Displays all dependencies declared in root project 'continue-intellij-extension'\nrunIde - Runs the IDE instance with the developed plugin installed.\nverifyPluginConfiguration - Checks if Java and Kotlin compilers configuration meet IntelliJ SDK requirements\n```\n\n### Packaging\n\n- Unix: `./gradlew buildPlugin`\n- Windows: `./gradlew.bat buildPlugin`\n\nThis will generate a .zip file in `./build/distributions` with the version defined in [\n`./gradle.properties`](./gradle.properties)\n\n#### Installing the packaged extension\n\n- Navigate to the Plugins settings page (_Settings | Plugins_)\n- Click on the gear icon\n- Click _Install from disk_ and select the ZIP file in `./build/distributions`\n\n## Testing\n\nTest commands:\n\n- `./gradlew test` - to run **unit tests**\n- `./gradlew testIntegration` - to run **e2e tests**\n\n### About e2e tests\n\nThe e2e tests are written using [intellij-ide-starter](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-ide-starter).\nThe first run of the e2e tests may take a while because the required IDE needs\nto be downloaded. Note that these tests\nfully take control of your mouse while executing.\n\n#### Setup\n\nIf you are on macOS, you'll need to give IntelliJ permission to control your computer in order to run the e2e tests.\nOpen `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility` and toggle the switch for IntelliJ.\n\n#### Working with Intellij IDE Starter\n\nThe testing platform provides a rich DSL for most UI components in IntelliJ. However, if you want to interact with a\ncustom element, you can define your own XPath selector.\n\nTo do this, run an e2e test and visit [localhost:63343/api/remote-driver/](http://localhost:63343/api/remote-driver/) to\nview an HTML representation of the IDE's Swing component tree.\nSee [Integration Tests](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/integration-tests-ui.html#searching-components) for\nmore details about this workflow.\n"}

Message types in `constants/MessageTypes.kt`. Extension relays messages between core binary and webview.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Unit tests: `src/test/kotlin/`\n- E2E tests: UI automation with intellij-ui-test-robot\n- Test command: `./gradlew test`\n- Debug: `runIde` Gradle task\n\n## Key Integration Points\n\n- File operations via IntelliJ VFS\n- Editor integration for diffs/autocomplete\n- Git operations for repository context\n- Settings via IntelliJ platform storage\n"}
{"source":"github","repo":"continue","path":"extensions/vscode/e2e/README.md","content":"# E2E Tests\n\n## Setup\n\nWhen running e2e tests for the first time\n\n```bash\nnpm run e2e:all\n```\n\n## Run\n\nDepending on what code you update, you can use a faster loop to test your changes:\n\n- If you update the e2e test code and/or config.yaml/json, you can run `npm run e2e:quick`\n- If you update the extension code, you can run `npm run e2e:recompile`\n- If you update the gui code, you can run `npm run e2e:rebuild-gui`\n\n## Writing tests\n\nAll e2e tests are separated (by folder) into\n\n- `selectors` - functions that return elements\n- `actions` - functions that perform actions on the editor\n- `tests` - the actual tests, which are typically longer paths of functionality rather than individual actions\n\n### Why are my tests failing?\n\n- Did you place a `data-testid` on a React component instead of an actual HTML element?\n- Do you have a config.yaml locally but the test is failing when running with config.json in CI?\n- Is your `data-testid` or selector actually just wrong?\n- Are you inconsistently getting different behaviors? You can try adding a `TestUtils.waitForTimeout` between two events if you think it's caused by a race condition. Note that this may lead to flake down the road.\n- Alternatively, you can add a `TestUtils.waitForSuccess`\n\n### How is it connecting to the LLM?\n\n- This depends on the model provider written inside the `test-continue/config.json` and `test-continue/config.yaml`. If the model provider is `mock`, it will use `MockLLM`, and if it uses `test`, it will use `TestLLM`.\n\n### Quirks\n\n- For non-macOS systems, `codesign` is not available. You should run `npm run e2e:all-non-mac` instead of `npm run e2e:all`.\n"}
